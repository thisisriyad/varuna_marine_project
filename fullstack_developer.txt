FuelEU Maritime — Full-Stack Developer
Assignment
This assignment assesses your engineering ability, architectural clarity, and use
of AI agents (such as GitHub Copilot, Claude Code, Cursor Agent, OpenAI Codex,
etc.).
You will implement parts of a Fuel EU Maritime compliance platform: the frontend
dashboard and backend APIs handling route data, compliance balance (CB),
banking, and pooling.

General Objective
Build a minimal yet structured implementation of the Fuel EU Maritime compliance
module with:

• Frontend: React + TypeScript + TailwindCSS
• Backend: Node.js + TypeScript + PostgreSQL
• Architecture: Hexagonal (Ports & Adapters / Clean Architecture)
• Documentation: AI-agent usage markdowns (mandatory)
• Focus:
◦ Quality of domain modeling and separation of concerns
◦ Use of AI-agents efficiently (generation, refactoring, testing)
◦ Proper explanation of how those tools were used
AI Agent Usage & Documentation (Mandatory)
You must include the following markdown files:

1. AGENT_WORKFLOW.md
Document your agent usage, with the following sections:

# AI Agent Workflow Log ## Agents Used List all agents (Copilot, Cla
ude Code, Cursor Agent, etc.) ## Prompts & Outputs - Example 1: incl
ude the exact prompt and the generated snippet - Example 2: show how
you refined or corrected an output ## Validation / Corrections Descr
ibe how you verified and modified the agent output. ## Observations
- Where agent saved time - Where it failed or hallucinated - How you
combined tools effectively ## Best Practices Followed (e.g., used Cu
rsor’s `tasks.md` for code generation, Copilot inline completions fo
r boilerplate, Claude Code for refactoring)

2. README.md
Include:

• Overview
• Architecture summary (hexagonal structure)
• Setup & run instructions
• How to execute tests
• Screenshots or sample requests/responses
3. REFLECTION.md
Short essay (max 1 page):

• What you learned using AI agents
• Efficiency gains vs manual coding
• Improvements you’d make next time

FRONTEND TASK — React + Tailwind
Objective
Create a Fuel EU Compliance Dashboard with four tabs:
1. Routes
2. Compare
3. Banking
4. Pooling

All values and API responses originate from the backend service described below.

Architecture (Hexagonal pattern)
src/ core/ domain/ application/ ports/ adapters/ ui/ infrastructure/
shared/

• Core = domain entities, use-cases, and ports (no React dependencies)
• UI adapters = React components and hooks implementing inbound ports
• Infrastructure adapters = API clients implementing outbound ports
• Styling via TailwindCSS
Functional Requirements
(1) Routes Tab

• Display table of all routes fetched from /routes
• Columns: routeId, vesselType, fuelType, year, ghgIntensity (gCO₂e/MJ),
fuelConsumption (t), distance (km), totalEmissions (t)

• “Set Baseline” button → calls POST /routes/:routeId/baseline
• Filters: vesselType, fuelType, year
(2) Compare Tab

• Fetch baseline + comparison data from /routes/comparison
• Use target = 89.3368 gCO₂e/MJ (2 % below 91.16)
• Display:
◦ Table with baseline vs comparison routes
◦ Columns: ghgIntensity, % difference, compliant ( / )
◦ Chart (bar/line) comparing ghgIntensity values
• Formula:
percentDiff = ((comparison / baseline) − 1) × 100

(3) Banking Tab

Implements Fuel EU Article 20 – Banking.

• GET /compliance/cb?year=YYYY → shows current CB
• POST /banking/bank → banks positive CB
• POST /banking/apply → applies banked surplus to a deficit
• KPIs:
◦ cb_before , applied , cb_after
• Disable actions if CB ≤ 0; show errors from API
(4) Pooling Tab
Implements Fuel EU Article 21 – Pooling.

• GET /compliance/adjusted-cb?year=YYYY → fetch adjusted CB per ship
• POST /pools → create pool with members
• Rules:
◦ Sum(adjustedCB) ≥ 0
◦ Deficit ship cannot exit worse
◦ Surplus ship cannot exit negative
• UI:
◦ List members with before/after CBs
◦ Pool Sum indicator (red/green)
◦ Disable “Create Pool” if invalid

Use dependency-inverted modules:
core → ports → adapters.
Frameworks (Express/Prisma/etc.) only in adapters/infrastructure.

Seed the five routes above; set one baseline = true.

Core Formulas
• Target Intensity (2025) = 89.3368 gCO₂e/MJ
• Energy in scope (MJ) ≈ fuelConsumption × 41 000 MJ/t
• Compliance Balance = ( Target − Actual ) × Energy in scope
• Positive CB → Surplus ; Negative → Deficit
Endpoints
/routes

•
•
•

GET /routes → all routes
POST /routes/:id/baseline → set baseline
GET /routes/comparison → baseline vs others

/compliance

•

GET /compliance/cb?shipId&year

◦ Compute and store CB snapshot
•

GET /compliance/adjusted-cb?shipId&year

◦ Return CB after bank applications
/banking

•
•
•

GET /banking/records?shipId&year
POST /banking/bank — bank positive CB
POST /banking/apply — apply banked surplus

◦ Validate amount ≤ available banked
/pools

•

POST /pools

◦ Validate ∑ CB ≥ 0
◦ Enforce:
▪ Deficit ship cannot exit worse
▪ Surplus ship cannot exit negative
◦ Greedy allocation:
▪ Sort members desc by CB
▪ Transfer surplus to deficits
◦ Return cb_after per member
Testing Checklist
• Unit — ComputeComparison, ComputeCB, BankSurplus, ApplyBanked,
CreatePool

• Integration — HTTP endpoints via Supertest
• Data — Migrations + Seeds load correctly
• Edge cases — Negative CB, over-apply bank, invalid pool
