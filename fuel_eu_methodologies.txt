I.​ Introduction
I.1.​ About This Document
This document provides guidance and best practices to understand and implement the
calculations as set out under Regulation (EU) 2023/18051 (hereafter ‘FuelEU’). Developed
under Workstream 1 (WS1) of the Sustainable Alternative Power for Shipping (SAPS)
subgroup of the European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF), it incorporates the collective
knowledge and expert insights of the workstream members to explain and clarify formulas
and requirements through actionable, detailed instructions.
The primary audience for this document is companies and organizations impacted by the
FuelEU. This includes shipping companies (referred to as ‘company’2) directly responsible
for compliance, as well as entities throughout the maritime value chain affected by the
regulation. For example, marine fuel and technology suppliers seeking to assess the
potential compliance surplus or deficit associated with a given energy product under the
FuelEU.
This document provides detailed methods for calculating compliance with FuelEU Article 4
and applying flexibility mechanisms in Article 20 and 21, namely banking, borrowing, and
pooling. It includes practical step-by-step examples and calculation methodologies. Values
used in the calculation examples are sourced from legislative texts or are illustrative values
to demonstrate the calculation procedure. In practice, values that are not fixed in the
legislative texts should align with the certification process which has been detailed in the
SAPS Workstream 2 (WS2) document titled 'Report on Marine Fuels Certification
Procedures to support implementation of FuelEU.'3
This document presents the legal text in a format tailored for industry implementation.
Readers should note that only the referenced legislative texts are legally binding. Where
interpretation of the legal requirements is necessary to support practical calculation
methodologies, it is clearly identified in the document. The development of calculation
methodologies was based on industry best practices and expert input from WS1. While
every effort has been made to ensure accuracy and consistency with the legislation and
existing interpretations, it should be noted that the ultimate authority on regulatory
compliance rests with the EU legislative texts and the Court of Justice of the European
Union.

I.2.​ Scope of the Guidance Document
This document is designed to cover necessary aspects for understanding and implementing
the compliance with Article 4 with greater explanation of the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity

methodologies needed to determine emission factors, compliance balance, and any
penalties.
2.​ Extra-EEA Voyages: Explains the calculation of compliance balance for voyages
between European Economic Area (EEA) Member State4 ports and third countries or
Outermost Regions.
3.​ Technology-Specific Calculations: Offers support for additional calculation
methodologies required for specific technologies.
4.​ Flexibility Mechanisms: Describes the rules and requirements for implementing
mechanisms outlined in FuelEU Article 20 and 21, including pooling, banking, and
borrowing.
This document does not cover all aspects of FuelEU. Sections of the regulation including the
obligation to use on-shore power supply (OPS), or the RFNBO subtarget are not included in
the guidance.
The content stems from extensive consultations and collaboration among ESSF experts,
aiming for precision and practical applicability. While the guidance represents the industry's
current understanding, it is not legally binding nor should it be considered investment advice.
Values used in examples are solely to illustrate calculation methodologies and should not be
interpreted as recommendations.

I.3.​ Purpose of the Guidance
The purpose of this document is to clarify the steps needed to calculate the compliance
balance laid out in Annex I, II, IV, and V of FuelEU as well as the steps for complying with
flexibility mechanisms in Articles 20 and 21. It provides step-by-step instructions for
stakeholders, offering practical advice and detailed breakdowns of the provisions in the
regulation.

I.4.​ Overview of the FuelEU
Adopted in 2023 and published in the Official Journal of the EU on 22 September 2023,
FuelEU is a pivotal component of the EU’s strategy to reduce GHG emissions from maritime
transport. The regulation mandates the progressive use of renewable and low-carbon fuels
to decrease emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O). It
builds on the certification and GHG reduction framework developed under the Renewable
Energy Directive (RED) to ensure a consistent approach to calculating emissions reductions
across legislative texts.
Central to the regulation is the concept of Well-to-Wake (WtW) GHG emissions, which
considers the full lifecycle emissions of maritime fuels. FuelEU specifies methodologies for
4

The FuelEU Maritime Regulation is a text with EEA relevance, which means that, following incorporation into the EEA Agreement, the
Regulation will apply to EU Member States and Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (except Svalbard).

calculating the GHG intensity of energy used onboard ships, outlined in Annex I, and
provides default emission factors in Annex II. These methodologies are critical for ensuring
that all maritime fuels, whether fossil-based or renewable, are assessed fairly and
consistently.
The regulation also introduces a compliance balance mechanism, effective 1 January 2025.
Verifiers annually calculate the attained GHG intensity for each ship, comparing it against a
declining limit, or targets, set by the regulation. Figure 1 shows the GHG intensity limit which
decreases every five years, requiring gradual improvement in GHG intensity and the
adoption of lower-emission technologies. Ships can engage in flexibility mechanisms such
as banking surplus emissions reductions, borrowing future allowances, or pooling emissions
with other ships to meet or exceed targets. For ships that fail to meet required GHG intensity
(i.e., compliance balance in deficit), a financial penalty is imposed, calculated per metric ton
of deficit emissions. For stakeholders to implement the requirements requires a careful
understanding of the FuelEU and associated legal texts.

I.5.​ Legal Framework (FuelEU and Annex I, II, IV and V
Overview)
The calculation of the compliance balance is focused on several key FuelEU annexes, each
outlining specific aspects of compliance:
●​ Annex I: Provides methodologies for calculating the GHG intensity of maritime fuels.
●​ Annex II: Lists default emission factors for various fuel types.
●​ Annex IV: Details requirements for monitoring and reporting emissions.

1.​ Chapter 1: General Calculations and
Principles
1.1.​ Introduction and Key Concepts
This chapter introduces the foundational concepts and calculations required to implement
Article 4 of the FuelEU. Chapter 1 focuses on the most straightforward cases: vessels
operating between or within ports of the European Economic Area (EEA), using fossil fuels,
biofuels, or renewable fuels of non-biological origin (RFNBOs). The EEA, comprising EU
member states along with Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway (except Svalbard), defines the
geographic scope of the regulation.
These cases serve to demonstrate the core principles and methodologies for understanding
the application of the equations to calculate FuelEU compliance. Subsequent chapters build
on this foundation by addressing how to apply the regulation to voyages involving non-EEA
ports (Chapter 2), incorporating technologies such as wind-assisted propulsion or onshore
power supply (Chapter 3), and applying flexibility mechanisms such as banking, borrowing,
and pooling (Chapter 4).
Several key concepts are helpful to understanding the calculations:
●​ Compliance Balance: The measure of a ship’s over- or under-compliance with the
limits for the yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship.
This calculation is performed in accordance with Part A of Annex IV, as stipulated in
Article 3(35) of FuelEU.
●​ E value: The total GHG emission information found in a Proof of Sustainability
(PoS), as issued by the certified fuel supplier to demonstrate compliance with
GHG/sustainability certification rules. The E value is regarded as a WtW figure under
RED, as it reads “from supply and use of the fuel (gCO2eq/MJ)”.6 It is used in the
FuelEU to determine the emission factor for non-fossil fuels.
●​ Extra-EEA: For voyages between a port under the jurisdiction of an EEA Member
State and a port under the jurisdiction of a third country (or vice-versa), the
Regulation applies to ships for one half of the energy used.
●​ GHG Intensity: The well-to-wake (WtW) greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions
associated with the energy used onboard a vessel, expressed in grams of CO₂
equivalent per megajoule (gCO₂eq/MJ). This metric accounts for all GHG emissions
from the extraction or cultivation of raw materials through to fuel combustion
onboard. It includes emissions of carbon dioxide (CO₂), methane (CH₄), and nitrous
oxide (N₂O), each converted into CO₂ equivalents using their 100-year global
warming potential (GWP). The WtW GHG intensity is composed of two parts:
○​ Well-to-tank (WtT) emissions: GHG emissions from the extraction,
production, and delivery of the fuel up to the point it is onboard the vessel.
○​ Tank-to-wake (TtW) emissions: GHG emissions from the combustion or use
of the fuel onboard the vessel, including any methane slip or fugitive
emissions.

●​ Intra-EEA: The Regulation applies to ships for the entirety of the energy used on
voyages between ports under the jurisdiction of EEA Member States as well as the
energy used while the ship is at berth7 and the energy used within EEA ports when
the ship is not at berth (e.g., moving within a port of call between two voyages).
●​ LCV (Lower Calorific Value): The amount of usable energy released when a fuel is
combusted as expressed in megajoules per gram (MJ/g), and reflecting the net
energy content available for propulsion or onboard use.
●​ Proof of Compliance (PoC): A solution mentioned in EU ETS and MRV guidance
document no.18 and endorsed by SAPS WS2,9 for instances when the original PoS is
not available, typically because it has been surrendered to meet national targets. It
provides equivalent sustainability and GHG data to support claims under FuelEU.
●​ Proof of Sustainability (PoS): A sustainability declaration document issued under
an EU-approved voluntary scheme, demonstrating that a fuel meets RED II
sustainability criteria. It includes the fuel's well-to-wake GHG emissions (E value, in
gCO₂eq/MJ) and is required under FuelEU for non-fossil fuels.
●​ Slip: Non-combusted fuel that escapes as fugitive or engine slip emissions, most
relevant for gaseous fuels such as LNG.
This chapter first outlines the general calculation principles for determining GHG intensity,
followed by the methodology for calculating the compliance balance and associated
penalties. It concludes with a series of examples demonstrating how these calculations are
applied in practice.

1.2.​ GHG Intensity Calculation: Step-by-Step Guidance
1.2.1.​

Overview of the GHG intensity formulas

This section details the formulas and variables involved in the calculation of GHG intensity
as specified in FuelEU Annex I. This is the first step to calculating compliance with the
FuelEU. While the fuel specific GHG intensity calculations in paragraph 1.2 of this guidance
document are considered on a per metric tonne basis, it is important to note that the GHG
emission intensity of each fuel is used to derive the annual weighted average WtW emission
intensity of the ship’s consumed energy.
According to the FuelEU, the following formula is used to calculate the GHG intensity of the
energy consumed on board a ship:
Equation (1)
𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 ⎡⎢
⎣

𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞
𝑀𝐽

⎤ =𝑓

As per Article 3 of the MRV Maritime Regulation, a ship is to be considered at berth when ‘securely moored or anchored in a port falling under
the jurisdiction of a Member State while it is loading, unloading or hoteling, including the time spent when not engaged in cargo operations’. The
ship will also be considered as ‘at berth’ when engaging in any operation other than cargo handling within port (e.g. bunkering, positioning,
inspections, etc.) between arrival at first berth and departure from last berth as long as the ship is securely moored or anchored within port limits.

Variable and subscript definitions per Annex I
●​ 𝐶𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝 𝑗 is the non-combusted fuel coefficient as a percentage of the mass of the fuel i
consumed by fuel unit j. Cslip includes fugitive and slipped emissions. ​
●​ 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞, 𝑇𝑡𝑊, 𝑖, 𝑗 is the TtW CO2 equivalent emissions of combusted fuel i in fuel consumer
unit j (g CO2eq/g Fuel). ​
●​ 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞, 𝑇𝑡𝑊, 𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝, 𝑖, 𝑗 is the TtW CO2 equivalent emissions of slipped fuel i towards fuel
consumer unit j (g CO2eq/g Fuel).

TtW emissions from combustion
The TtW CO2 equivalent emission intensity includes CH4 and N2O emissions from fuels as
part of 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑇𝑡𝑊 . Reference is made to the Columns 7 and 8 of the table in FuelEU Annex II,
which provides default CH4 and N2O emission factors (in g CH4/g fuel and g N2O/g fuel
respectively).
These factors are required to calculate the 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑇𝑡𝑊 , which is defined in FuelEU Annex I as

For the calculation of the GHG intensity in carbon dioxide equivalences (𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞) of the energy
used onboard the ship (TtW), FuelEU mandates that companies should apply the GWP as
defined over a period of 100 years in RED paragraph 4 of Part C of Annex V for all GHG
types i.e., carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), and nitrous oxide (N2O).
Accordingly, the GWP100 values11 to be used for FuelEU TtW calculations are:

TtW emissions from slip
​
The TtW formula and the table in FuelEU Annex II account for fuel slippage, including
fugitive and slipped emissions (“Cslip”, as a percentage of mass, see table FuelEU Annex II
column 9), if applicable. In case no slippage coefficient is provided in the table in FuelEU
Annex II, it should be assumed as zero13. The slipped amount is a separate element in the
TtW formula. While Cslip is deducted in the calculation of combusted fuel emissions, slip is
separately accounted for by its impact on the total TtW emission intensity.

The added slip emission intensity ( 100 𝐶𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝 𝑗 × 𝐶𝑂

) follows from Annex I as:

2𝑒𝑞 𝑇𝑡𝑊, 𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝, 𝑖, 𝑗

Note that the slip factors for CO2 and N2O are set to 0 by FuelEU Annex 1, irrespective of the
fuel class or pathway. The added slip emission intensity impact can therefore be simplified to
1

( 100 𝐶𝑠𝑙𝑖𝑝 𝑗 × 𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻 ), which suggests that all slip emissions are considered to be methane

only. ​
It should be noted that, according to FuelEU Article 10(5), shipping companies can diverge
from default values for CH4 and N2O by using actual values certified by laboratory testing or
direct emission measurements. However, FuelEU Article 10(6) mandates an implementing
act to specify which international standards and certification references are accepted for
demonstrating actual tank-to-wake emission factors. The IMO is currently developing such
standards, which are expected to be referenced in FuelEU only after their completion. Until
then, only default factors can be used.
Apart from the mass of fuel, the wind-assisted propulsion reward factors, RFNBO reward
factors, and the electricity delivered, values for the elements in the above formulas are
included in the table in FuelEU Annex II for various fuel classes and pathways. These
additional elements are covered in Chapter 2.

EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.1 states that where default slippage coefficients are not listed for a specific emission source class,
companies should apply a slippage coefficient of zero https://www.emsa.europa.eu/faq-monitoring-plan.html. However, future revisions of the
regulation could include slippage for other gases.

Figure 2. FuelEU Annex II Table column references and headers

The different Fuel Classes in Column 1 are Fossil, Biofuels, RFNBO/e-Fuels, and Others14.
Since these fuel classes have different calculation methods for the WtT GHG emission factor
(i.e., 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇 ), they are considered individually in this Chapter.
Certain TtW emission factors are still under development and some cells in the table of
Annex II indicate ‘To Be Measured (TBM)’ or ‘Not Available (N/A)’.
Where a cell indicates either TBM or N/A, unless a value is demonstrated in accordance
with Article 10, the highest default value of the fuel class in the same column shall be
used.
For all cells containing 'TBM' or 'N/A' in the table found in Annex II, the highest default value
in the fuel class is assigned and bolded in the tables within this guidance document.
Deviating from FuelEU Annex II, note that ethane as a marine fuel in use has been added in
the fossil fuel sections of this guidance document, while Annex II bio-H2, e-LPG, and e-DME
pathways are left out in this guidance document, due to the current lack of necessary default
values.

1.2.2.​

Fossil fuels

To calculate WtW emission intensities for fossil fuels, the relevant values from the table in
FuelEU Annex II should be used.
The relevant values for WtW emission intensity calculation purposes are shown in Table 2.

14

The Fuel Class “Others” concerns the energy from electricity from on-shore power supply (OPS), elaborated on in Chapter 3. Note that
Recycled Carbon Fuels (RCFs) (e.g. pyrolysis oil) and other synthetic low-carbon fuels (e.g. “blue ammonia”) are not included in Annex II of
FuelEU and this guidance document.

Note on Ethane: While ethane is not found in Annex II, it has been included as a marine
fuel in use. It is recommended in the ETS/MRV General Guidance 116 to use the default
TtW emission factor of 2.927 tCO2/t fuel from resolution MEPC.364(79) EEDI Guidelines.17
All other values shown are in-line with the approach outlined in FuelEU Article 10.2, which
requires use of the least favorable fossil fuel pathway for fuels not covered. We aligned its
WtT with LNG and non-CO₂ emission factors with HFO, assuming least favorable fossil
values. This approach ensures consistency with FuelEU and relevant guidance until more
specific data becomes available.

Ethane is not included in Annex II and therefore the values in the grey shaded row represent suggested values for the pathway. See note on

The following section provides a detailed breakdown of how the WtW emission intensity of a
particular fossil fuel pathway is derived, using HFO (Grade RME to RMK) as an example.
As stated in FuelEU Annex I:
The WtT GHG emission factors (CO2eqWtT,i) default values are contained in Annex II. In
the case of fossil fuels, only the default values contained in Annex II shall be used.
For example, as shown in Table X, the CO2eqWtT,i is 13.5 gCO2eq/MJ. (See also FuelEU
Annex II column 4).
Applying the WtT GHG intensity formula (Equation 1), using 1 metric tonne for illustrative
purposes:
𝑛 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙

∑ 𝑀𝑖 × 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝑖 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖

𝑊𝑡𝑇 = 𝑛 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙𝑖

=

𝑖

1 × 13.5 × 0.0405
1 × 0.0405 × 1 + 0

= 13.5 gCO2eq/MJ

𝑘

In the same way, using the relevant values from the table in FuelEU Annex II, recalling the
TtW formula, and given Equation (2) and the corresponding GWP100 values, the TtW
emission intensity of consumed HFO is calculated as follows:

1 × 0.0405 × 1 + 0

=

= 78.24420 gCO2eq/MJ.

Recalling Equation (1), the total WtW emission intensity of HFO is the sum of the calculated
WtT and TtW emission intensities:
𝑊𝑡𝑊 𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 13. 5 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 + 78. 24420 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 = 91.74420 gCO2eq/MJ
Applying the applicable GHG intensity formula from Annex I (Equation 1) and including the
values from Table 2 (FuelEU Annex II), the resulting WtW GHG intensity per unit of energy of
different fossil fuels types is as shown in Table 3.

Biofuels (liquid and gaseous)

For RED certified liquid and gaseous biofuels, the WtT GHG emission intensity (CO2eqWtT)
for each fuel consumer is to be calculated as per column 4 of the table in FuelEU Annex II,
as follows:​
𝑊𝑡𝑇 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 = 𝐸 −

𝐶𝑓𝐶𝑂2
𝐿𝐶𝑉

where E = Total GHG emission intensity (gCO2eq/MJ) from the supply and use of the fuel, as
per the Proof of Sustainability (PoS) or Proof of Compliance (PoC)19 of the certified biofuel.
Without a PoS/PoC, or where the biofuel does not meet the sustainability criteria20 and GHG
emissions savings criteria21, or that are produced from food and feed crops, referred to in
FuelEU Article 10(1)(a), the emission factors (WtT and TtW) of the least favourable fossil
fuel pathway for the type of fuel in question should be used.
In Table 4, default values for E are used22 to calculate the WtT emission intensities in column
4 accordingly. If the actual E value from the PoS / PoC differs from the default value, the
value from the PoS/PoC should be used to calculate the actual WtT emission intensity of the
biofuel pathway.

18

Ethane is not included in Annex II and therefore the values in the grey shaded row represent suggested values for the pathway. See note on
ethane.

Note on biomethane E values: The default upstream emissions (E value) for biomethane
used in the FuelEU Maritime context are taken from RED II Annex VI D, using the value of
14 gCO₂e/MJ for biowaste-derived biomethane with closed digestate storage and off-gas
combustion. This illustrative value provides an example of emissions up to the point of
injection into the natural gas grid. However, it does not include emissions from liquefaction
or bunkering, which are necessary to deliver biomethane to ships as a marine fuel and are
counted in the TtW emissions.
To provide an example value for these additional emissions we use methodologies
outlined in ISCC 205 (v4.1, January 2024).23 The guideline under the ISCC EU scheme,
includes a method known as “liquefaction by equivalence” for estimating emissions when
terminal-specific data is not available.
Liquefaction Emissions: Methodology and Calculation
ISCC 205 Section 4.3.5 allows operators to calculate liquefaction emissions using a
benchmark method that reflects average EU conditions. Based on this method,
liquefaction emissions are estimated as follows:
●​ Electricity use for liquefaction: 0.06048 MJ electricity (LV or low voltage) per MJ
fuel, is converted to kWh:
0. 06048 𝑀𝐽𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦, 𝐿𝑉/𝑀𝐽𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 × 1𝑘𝑊ℎ/ 3. 6 𝑀𝐽𝑒𝑙𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑖𝑡𝑦 = 0. 0168 𝑘𝑊ℎ/𝑀𝐽 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙. ​
●​ GHG intensity of electricity:24 EU27 low-voltage average = 308 gCO₂e/kWh​
●​ Resulting liquefaction emissions: 0. 0168 × 308 = 5. 17 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑒​
●​ Adjustment for ISCC “conversion losses”: ISCC 205 recommends applying a
Feedstock Factor (FF) of 1.00013 to account for a 0.013% conversion loss, which
has a negligible numerical impact but aligns with ISCC/RED methodology.
Therefore, the upstream emissions values used in our calculations, including the RED II
Annex VI D value (14 gCO2eq/MJ) plus liquefaction are:
𝐸𝑏𝑖𝑜𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑒, 𝑙𝑖𝑞 = 14 + 5. 17 = 19. 17 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/𝑀𝐽​
These liquefaction emissions are an illustrative example based on ISCC 205 Guidance.
However, where actual data is available, operators can potentially achieve lower
emissions factors depending on the liquefaction technology and location. Here are two
examples:
●​ Recondenser-based liquefaction is the standard technology at LNG terminals,
using boil-off gas to liquefy biomethane efficiently. It typically consumes ~200 kWh
per tonne of biomethane,25 resulting in an estimated CI of ~1.23 gCO₂e/MJ using
EU low voltage grid data (see figure in previous calculation). Actual values vary by
terminal and operating conditions.
23

ISCC 205 is the guidance document titled "Greenhouse Gas Emissions", which outlines methodologies for calculating life-cycle emissions,
including options for liquefaction by equivalence and bunkering emissions. The latest version (v4.1, January 2024) is available at:
https://www.iscc-system.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/ISCC_EU_205_Greenhouse-Gas-Emissions_v4.1_January2024.pdf
24

The GHG emissions from electricity in the EU of 308 gCO2e/kWh is from IR (EU) 2022/996:
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/eli/reg_impl/2022/996/oj/eng. We use EU-wide GHG emissions to provide an example value. To select the
country/location where the liquifaction will take place, see the respective Low Voltage GHG intensity from the Publications Office:
https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32022R0996

●​ Reliquefaction systems use external refrigeration and are typically found at peak
shaving or low-send-out terminals. They are less efficient, with emissions
depending on design and scale. No default CI exists, so site-specific data or
conservative estimates should be used.
Operators are encouraged to gather terminal-specific electricity consumption data or apply
“equivalence” with ISCC auditor approval, as required under ISCC EU certification
schemes.
Bunkering Emissions (not included above)
Emissions from bio-LNG bunkering are also relevant and should be reported under Etd
(emissions from transport and distribution). These vary with bunker vessel type, fuel used,
and round-trip distance. ISCC 205 provides useful guidance on how to calculate such
emissions (but does not provide relevant emissions). A value for bunkering is not included
in the 19.17 gCO₂e/MJ value above but the bunkering emissions would be included in a
PoS and should be considered in full well-to-wake calculations.

For LCV, the main reference in FuelEU Annex II table (see column 3) is the default LCV
values in RED Annex III. In Table 4, the RED Annex III default LCV values are used
(converted to MJ/g). When biofuel production pathways do not have default LCVs as per
legal reference, the LCV or information to derive the LCV from the PoS/PoC provided by the
fuel supplier should be based on a lab analysis.

Including additional fuel pathways and fuel consumers, the relevant values for WtW emission
intensity calculation purposes are shown in Table 4.

apply from 2034 if the share of RFNBOs in the total fuel mix remains below 1% for the
Reporting Period 2031, among other conditions. This subtarget is outside the scope of the
current WS1 document.
Defined under Article 5(1) of FuelEU, the multiplier rewards the use of RFNBOs until 31
December 2033. FuelEU Annex 5 (1) reads:

For the calculation of the GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a ship, from 1
January 2025 to 31 December 2033 a multiplier of ‘2’ can be used to reward the ship for
the use of RFNBO. The methodology for this calculation is set out in Annex I.

The methodology for calculating the GHG intensity of energy used on board, which includes
the RFNBO multiplier, is specified in Annex I of FuelEU. The calculation of WtW GHG
intensity with the multiplier or ‘reward factor’ is illustrated below. The impact on a vessel’s
compliance balance can be found in Examples 4 and 6 provided in Section 1.4 of this
document.
For RFNBOs, the WtT emissions (CO2eqWtT) in column 4 of the table in FuelEU Annex II
refer to RED. The relevant supplementing Delegated Regulation31 stipulates that the certified
E value (from the PoS/PoC) determines the GHG emissions for RFNBOs. To calculate the
WtT emissions from RFNBOs or e-fuels, the emissions from the fuel in use (eu) include all
combustion emissions and should be deducted. This aims to avoid double counting of
emissions under FuelEU where the TtW emissions are added separately. A deduction of the
CO2 emission as done for biofuels, is not needed.
For RFNBOs, the FuelEU WtT emissions (CO2eqWtT) are calculated as: 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇 = 𝐸 − 𝑒𝑢 ,
where E = Total GHG emission intensity (g CO2eq/MJ) from the supply and use of the fuel,
as per the Proof of Sustainability (PoS) or Proof of Compliance (PoC)32 of the certified
biofuel. The 𝑒𝑢 value is the emissions from the combusted fuel in use, as per the PoS/PoC.
In Table 6, E values for RFNBOs we use the arbitrary value of 10 g CO2eq/MJ to illustrate
the calculation of WtT emission intensities in column 4 accordingly. This is an example value
only. In practice, E should be taken from a PoS or PoC, demonstrating compliance with EU
certification requirements.
Note on RFNBO E Value: For illustrative purposes, we have selected an E value of 10 g
CO2eq/MJ. This value falls within the allowed range up to 28.2 g CO2eq/MJ according to
the RED Delegated Regulation (EU) 2023/1185, which requires a minimum reduction of
70% in GHG emissions compared to the comparator baseline of 94 gCO2eq/MJ. The
chosen value of 10 g CO2eq/MJ is arbitrary and chosen to avoid representing any specific
RFNBO pathway, while providing a credible example.

RFNBO type fuels, with and without applying the RFNBO reward factor, are shown in Table

As a reminder, WtT emission intensities in Table 7 are calculated based on assumed
indicative emission intensity values. For actual WtT emission intensities calculations of the
various RFNBO pathways (𝐸 − 𝑒𝑢), the actual respective emission intensities (𝐸 and 𝑒𝑢

1.3.​ Compliance Balance: Step-by-Step Guidance
1.3.1.​

Overview of the compliance balance formula

The next step in the FuelEU calculations is the ‘compliance balance’ formula as provided in
FuelEU Annex IV. The compliance balance is defined in FuelEU Article 3(35):
‘compliance balance’ means the measure of a ship’s over- or under-compliance with
regard to the limits for the yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a
ship or the RFNBO subtarget, which is calculated in accordance with Part A of Annex IV
The compliance balance calculations determine a ship's positive compliance due to
over-achievement of the annual target (i.e., compliance surplus), or negative compliance
balance from under-achievement of the annual target (i.e., compliance deficit). At the
discretion of the company,34 ships can choose to participate in flexibility mechanisms defined
in Articles 20 and 21, such as banking surplus compliance, borrowing from future
compliance balance, and pooling of surplus compliance (see Chapter 4). Ships failing to
meet annual targets are subject to a financial penalty. To translate this into practical terms,
the following section describes the compliance balance formula and penalty, showing how to
determine whether a ship has met, exceeded, or fallen short of the annual GHG intensity
target.
34

‘Company’ is the entity responsible for the operation of the ship according to definition FuelEU Article 3(13).

Compliance balance formula breakdown (Annex IV Part A)

As specified in the FuelEU Annex IV Part A, the formula for calculating a ship's compliance
balance is given as:
𝑛𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙

𝑐

𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 [𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞] = (𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 − 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙) × [ ∑ 𝑀𝑖 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖 + ∑ 𝐸𝑘]
𝑖

𝑘

Variable and subscript definitions per Annex I and IV
●​ 𝐶𝑂₂𝑒: Carbon dioxide equivalent, is a measure typically expressed in grams or
tonnes and is used to compare the emissions of various greenhouse gases based on
their global warming potential. It provides a way of expressing the impact of methane
(CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O) gas in terms of the amount of CO₂ that would create
the same amount of warming.
●​ 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡: This is the GHG intensity limit for the energy used on board the ship in a
given Reporting Period, as stipulated by Article 4(2) of FuelEU.
●​ 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙: This represents the yearly average of the GHG intensity of the energy
used on board, calculated for the relevant Reporting Period based on Annex I (see
1.2.1).
●​ 𝑖: Index corresponding to the fuel types delivered to the ship in the Reporting Period.
●​ 𝑀𝑖: Mass of fuel type i, consumed by the ship in terms of grams of fuel.
●​ 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖: Lower calorific value of fuel type i in terms of megajoules per gram of fuel
(MJ/gFuel), which measures the amount of heat released by burning one gram of the
fuel.
●​ 𝐸𝑘: Energy in the form of electricity delivered to the ship through an OPS connection
point k in terms of MJ.
●​ 𝑘: Index corresponding to the OPS connection points.
The compliance balance formula calculates the difference between the annual target from (
𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡) and reported GHG intensity (𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙), scaled by the sum of total energy
consumption from fuels and shore-side electricity within the scope of the FuelEU. A positive
result indicates surplus compliance, while a negative result signals a compliance deficit.

1.3.3.​

Penalty formula breakdown (Annex IV Part B)

As specified in the FuelEU Annex IV Part B, the formula for calculating a ship's penalty is
given as:
𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙𝐸𝑈 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦 [𝐸𝑈𝑅] =

|𝐶𝑜𝑚𝑝𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝐵𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒|
𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙× 41,000

× 2, 400

Explanations of constants in the formula:
●​ 41, 000 𝑀𝐽/𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙: This constant, expressed in megajoules per tonne (MJ/tfuel),
represents the LCV of Very Low Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) which is used to convert

​

pg. 26

the compliance balance and GHGIEactual into a VLSFO equivalent emissions deficit in
tonnes.
●​ 2, 400 𝐸𝑈𝑅/𝑡𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙: This is the penalty rate applied per metric tonne of VLSFO
equivalent emissions deficit.
The penalty calculation starts by taking the absolute compliance deficit on a weighted energy
basis, indicating the total emission deficit. This is then divided by the attained GHGIEactual,
which is converted to an emission intensity per ton of VLSFO equivalent by multiplying with
the constant LCV of 41,000 MJ/t. The result is a VLSFO equivalent deficit in tonnes. The
final step in the penalty calculation process involves multiplying the VLSFO equivalent
emissions by the penalty rate of 2,400 EUR to determine the total financial penalty.
Note on the Penalty Calculation: The fixed penalty rate of €2,400 per metric tonne
applies to a VLSFO-equivalent compliance deficit. It applies to the amount of energy that
is in deficit relative to the respective FuelEU GHG intensity target, expressed in VLSFO
equivalent tonnes. A vessel is therefore not directly penalised for burning e.g., HFO or
LFO, but rather penalized to the extent it fails to reach the respective GHG target in that
particular year, resulting in an energy weighted compliance deficit.
Penalty calculation for two or more consecutive Reporting Periods
Ships with recurring compliance deficits in consecutive years will incur an additional charge.
The total penalty for each subsequent year increases by an additional 10% annually. The
additional charge stated in Article 23(2) can be expressed as:
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦 = 𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙𝐸𝑈 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦×(1 + (𝑛 − 1) × 0. 10)
●​ n: The number of consecutive non-compliant Reporting Periods.
For example, if a ship has a compliance deficit for three consecutive Reporting Periods, in
the Verification Period following the third year, the calculation of the total penalty would
include an additional charge of 20%. The equation above with 𝑛 = 3 is as follows:
(𝑛 − 1) × 0. 10 = (3 − 1) × 0. 10 = 0. 20
If the penalty calculated in the third year is €5,000, the total penalty would be:
𝑇𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑃𝑒𝑛𝑎𝑙𝑡𝑦 = 5, 000 𝐸𝑈𝑅 × (1 + 0. 20) = 6, 000 𝐸𝑈𝑅
In this example, the ship will have to pay a penalty of €6,000 in addition to previous penalties
owed. Non-compliance with penalty payments can lead to enforcement actions as specified
under Article 23.
The penalty does not increase in case the ship has a Reporting Period where it did not have
any voyages in scope of the regulation (year Y) and in year Y-1 and year Y+1 was subject to
penalties, since such scenario does not fulfill the ‘consecutive’ condition. In addition, the
penalty does not increase in case of shipping company changes, since 𝑛 represents the

FuelEU establishes limits to the yearly average GHG Intensity of the energy used on board a
ship, following a reference value and reduction targets.
In accordance with Article 4(2), the GHG Intensity reference value is 91.16 𝑔𝐶𝑂₂𝑒/MJ. The
𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 reduction and timeline is illustrated in Table 8.

Step 2: Calculate the Total Energy Consumption
The next step is to calculate the total fuel consumed during the Reporting Period on voyages
and port stays within the scope of the regulation. This requires summing the mass of each
type of fuel used, applying the following formula:
𝑛𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙

∑ 𝑀𝑖 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖
𝑖

Where 𝑀𝑖 represents the mass of each fuel type and 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖​ its corresponding lower calorific
value. Each fuel's mass is multiplied by its calorific value to convert mass to energy. The
total energy from all fuels is then aggregated.

been approved by any of the members of the ESSF group nor by the European Commission. Instead, it serves as a working draft for FuelEU calculation methodologies

​

If electricity was delivered via OPS during the Reporting Period in port stays within scope of
the regulation, it should be included using the following formula:
𝑐

∑ 𝐸𝑘
𝑘

where 𝐸𝑘​ represents the electricity in megajoules delivered through each OPS connection
point 𝑘. The sum of energy from both fuel and electricity provides the total energy
consumption in megajoules (MJ) needed for the compliance balance calculation.
In case vessels performed voyages covered by the exemptions provided by FuelEU Articles
2(3), 2(4), 2(5), and 2(6) related to voyages between EEA Member States and non-EEA
Member States or voyages to Outermost Region ports, energy calculated for the respective
legs should be reduced. In addition, deduction relating to sailing in ice conditions or the
technical characteristics of ice class ships is to be taken into consideration. Refer to Chapter
2 on Extra-EEA Voyages and Chapter 3 on Technology-Specific Calculations for more
information.
Step 3: Calculate the GHG Intensity Actual
The next step is to calculate the 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 according to Annex I and described in Section
1.2. When calculating the 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 for the compliance balance, the intensity of all fuel(s)
and energy used onboard falling under the FuelEU scope throughout the Reporting Period
should be taken into account. This calculation effectively produces a weighted average of
the GHG intensity for all fuels used, adjusted for the energy content of each fuel type used.
The formula is also impacted by the use of RFNBOs, ice navigation, and the use of
wind-assisted propulsion (see Chapter 3). The application of an RFNBO reward factor is
covered in Section 1.4 Examples 4 and 6.
Step 4: Compute the Compliance Balance
The compliance balance equation provides the difference between the target and actual
GHG intensities(𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 − 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙), multiplied by the total energy consumption
𝑛𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙

𝑐

[ ∑ 𝑀𝑖 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖 + ∑ 𝐸𝑘]. The result is the net compliance balance in grams of CO2
𝑖

𝑘

equivalent. A positive balance indicates that the ship is performing better than the target and
therefore generating a surplus. A negative balance indicates under-compliance and
therefore has a deficit.

Rounding rules

In the absence of established rounding rules for FuelEU at the time of publication, it is
recommended using the rounding conventions used in the EU Monitoring, Reporting, and
Verification (MRV) system, THETIS-MRV35, which is used to collect and manage data under
35

For further guidance see the THETIS MRV page on the EMSA site: https://www.emsa.europa.eu/thetis-mrv.html

​

pg. 29

the EU MRV Regulation (EU) 2015/757. Alignment with MRV conventions minimizes
calculation discrepancies between regulatory frameworks.
In alignment with MRV, it is proposed to round to five decimal places for all values involved
in the calculations. It should be avoided to round intermediate results to avoid deviations.
The only exception is in the penalty calculation, where the final penalty amount should be
rounded to the nearest integer.
Note on rounding to tonnes: In practice companies may choose to estimate their
compliance balance in units of tonnes CO2eq. When doing the actual calculation this
should be avoided.
For example, if you convert the following compliance balance to tonnes of CO2eq:
6

− 1, 255, 610, 552. 4 ÷ 10

= 1, 255 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞

and convert back to grams CO2eq you get the following compliance balance:
6

− 1, 255 × 10

=

− 1, 255, 000, 000 𝑔 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞

This leads to a different result in the penalty calculation.

1.4.​ Compliance Balance Calculation Examples
This section provides a series of compliance balance calculation examples that apply the
methodology for various fuels and energy combinations with consistent energy consumption.
Example 1 establishes a baseline scenario, which is then used for comparison in all
subsequent cases. For combinations involving multiple fuel types, we assume blending for
biofuels and dual-fuel engines for RFNBOs. Each example begins by setting an illustrative
amount of non-fossil fuel, with the fossil fuel quantity adjusted to ensure total energy use is
aligned with the baseline.
In all examples, table cells highlighted in yellow require user input, whereas white cells
contain fixed values established by legislation or are calculations based on given formulas.
Values established by FuelEU and relevant EU legislation or calculations based on
formulas in the text:

Note on the choice of example scenarios: The energy sources chosen or example

Example 2: Fossil LNG with two engine types (Intra-EEA)
In the second example, a vessel utilizes LNG as the primary fuel
source. The main engine, a LNG dual-fuel Otto cycle (low
pressure 4-stroke) designed for slow-speed operations, uses
LNG as well as MDO as a pilot fuel to facilitate combustion. In
addition to the main engine, the vessel is equipped with LNG
auxiliary engines, which are assumed to operate at medium speed. This results in varying
GHG emission factors for the different engines. The auxiliary's consumption of LNG is
intended to substitute approximately 1,000 tonnes of MDO, illustrating a common practice in
dual-fuel LNG vessels.

Example 4: Fossil HFO and RFNBO e-NH3 (Intra-EEA)
This example shows a dual-fuel ammonia vessel that is primarily
using HFO and MDO, and has bunkered 400 tonnes of
ammonia produced from renewable electricity, or eNH3. In this
example, we assume the eNH3 is certified as an RFNBO and is
therefore able to apply the RFNBO multiplier, i.e., RWD = 2.

ports, utilizing LNG as the primary fuel source and bunkering a
small amount of liquified biomethane. The main engine, a LNG
dual-fuel Otto cycle (low pressure 4-stroke) designed for
medium-speed operations, is using three fuels: fossil LNG,
liquified biomethane, as well as MDO as a pilot fuel to facilitate combustion. MDO is also
used in auxiliary engines.

applied to ships operating between EEA ports and non-EEA ports and Outermost Regions.
This includes how to implement exemptions and allocation of fuels to compliance balance
calculations.

2.​ Chapter 2: Extra-EEA Voyages
2.1.​ Introduction and Key Concepts
The following section provides guidance for applying the calculation methodologies from
Chapter 1 to voyages between European Economic Area (EEA) Member States and
non-EEA Member States within the scope of FuelEU, known as “Extra-EEA” voyages. The
section is complemented by additional guidance for technology-specific conditions in
Chapter 3.
In both the MRV Maritime Regulation and FuelEU, a voyage is considered from the last
berth or ship-to-ship transfer within a port of call37 to the first berth or ship-to-ship transfer in
the following port of call.
Furthermore, EU regulations also refer to Extra-EEA as ‘International Voyages’. This is
defined as a voyage by sea from a port in a Member State to a port outside that Member
State, and vice versa. Conversely, a ‘domestic voyage’ is a sea voyage from a port in a
Member State to the same or another port within that Member State.38
While voyages between EEA Member States (hereafter “Intra-EEA Voyages”) are in principle
international voyages, from a FuelEU perspective, these are treated differently from
international voyages between EEA Member States and third countries (hereafter
“Extra-EEA”). This distinction is important for calculation and compliance purposes, as it
defines the scope of energy falling under the FuelEU, as described in Article 2(1) of FuelEU:
This Regulation applies to all ships of above 5 000 gross tonnage that
serve the purpose of transporting passengers or cargo for commercial
purposes, regardless of their flag, in respect of:
(a) the energy used during their stay within a port of call under the
jurisdiction of a Member State;
(b) the entirety of the energy used on voyages from a port of call
under the jurisdiction of a Member State to a port of call under the
jurisdiction of a Member State;
(c) notwithstanding point (b), one half of the energy used on voyages
arriving at or departing from a port of call located in an outermost
region under the jurisdiction of a Member State; and
(d) one half of the energy used on voyages arriving at or departing
from a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, where
the previous or the next port of call is under the jurisdiction of a
third country.”
The FuelEU is relevant to the EEA, meaning that once incorporated into the EEA
Agreement, it will apply to EU Member States as well as Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway
37

FuelEU defines “port of call” as the port where a ship stops to load or unload cargo or to embark or disembark passengers. Regulation (EU)

(except Svalbard).39 In that case,ports of those countries should be understood as Member
State ports. Pending incorporation of the FuelEU into the EEA Agreement, Norwegian and
Icelandic ports should be treated as third-country (non-Member State) ports.
In addition, ports in Overseas Countries and Territories (‘OCT’) of the European Union
do not qualify as ports of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State.40 Additionally the
Faroe Islands (Denmark) and Svalbard (Norway) are excluded. Practically, this means that
voyages between a port of call in the excluded territories listed above and a port of call
under the jurisdiction of an EEA State constitute as "incoming" or "outgoing" voyages and
should be monitored and reported.
For regulatory clarity, we can identify four main FuelEU application scenarios, excluding
the various exemptions to FuelEU, that will be discussed in more detail in this chapter.
●​ Within port of call: Refers to the energy used while the ship is at berth41 and the
energy used within ports when the ship is not at berth (e.g., moving within a port of
call between two voyages).
●​ Intra-EEA Voyages: The Regulation applies to ships for the entirety of the energy
used on voyages between ports under the jurisdiction of EU/EEA Member States.
●​ Voyages to or from Outermost Regions (OMRs): OMRs are regions that, although
geographically distant from continental Europe, are part of the EU, including the
Azores, Canary Islands, and French Guiana. For voyages that start or end in an

for one half of the energy used.42
●​ Extra-EEA Voyages: For voyages between a port under the jurisdiction of an
EU/EEA Member State and a port under the jurisdiction of a third country (or vice
versa), the Regulation applies to ships for one half of the energy used.
Certain stops do not qualify as ports of call under FuelEU as stated in definition in Article
3(10), these are:
●​ Stops for the sole purposes of refuelling; obtaining supplies (including fodder for
vessels transporting animals as cargo); relieving the crew; going into dry-dock or
making repairs to the ship and/or its equipment;
●​ Stops in port because the ship is in need of assistance or in distress;
●​ Ship to ship transfers carried out outside ports;
●​ Stops for the sole purpose of taking shelter from adverse weather or rendered
necessary by search and rescue activities;
●​ Stops of containerships in a neighbouring container transhipment port listed in the
implementing act adopted pursuant to Article 2(2) of the FuelEU.
The fact that the above stops are excluded from the definition of ‘port of call’ does not mean
that the relevant energy falls out of scope, because whether the energy will fall within scope

As per Article 3 of the MRV Maritime Regulation, a ship is to be considered at berth when ‘securely moored or anchored in a port falling under
the jurisdiction of a Member State while it is loading, unloading or hoteling, including the time spent when not engaged in cargo operations’. The
ship will also be considered as ‘at berth’ when engaging in any operation other than cargo handling within port (e.g. bunkering, positioning,
inspections, etc.) between arrival at first berth and departure from last berth as long as the ship is securely moored or anchored within port limits.

2.2.​ Special Voyage Scenarios
This section outlines specific voyage scenarios requiring special considerations in terms of
the FuelEU calculations.

2.2.1.​

Exemptions for outermost region - Article 2(1)

Regulatory reference
Article 2(1)(c) of FuelEU applies to all ships of above 5,000 gross tonnage that transport
passengers or cargo for commercial purposes, regardless of their flag. This applies to one
half of the energy used on voyages arriving at or departing from a port of call located in an
outermost region under the jurisdiction of a Member State.
Introduction
Due to the special characteristics and constraints of the OMRs of the Union, particularly their
remoteness and insularity, special consideration is given to maintaining their accessibility
and efficient connectivity by maritime transport.
Two types of voyages related to OMR ports are exempted from the scope of FuelEU. These
exemptions will affect the reporting of energy used on board, GHG intensity calculation, and
the compliance strategies of relevant ships. This section focuses on the permanent
exemption for OMRs, while the following section covers the temporary exemptions for
specific OMR routes and ports as outlined in Article 2(4).
Definition of Outermost Regions
The EU includes nine OMRs, defined as territories in Article 349 TFEU44.
As explained in Chapter 2 of the EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.145, the term
‘ports of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State’ refers to ports located in EU territory
where EU law fully applies. Not all ports belonging to a Member State are considered EU
territories (see list below). For a voyage to be covered by the MRV Maritime Regulation, at
least one port of call should be located in an EU territory.

Energy scope falling under FuelEU
Only half of the energy used on voyages “departing from” or “arriving at” a port of call in an
OMR should be included in the scope of this Regulation, as per Article 2(1)(c). This is due to
the unique characteristics and constraints of the OMRs in the Union, particularly their
remoteness and insularity. Special consideration is given to preserving their accessibility and
efficient connectivity by maritime transport.
For the same reasons, there may be temporary exemptions for specific OMRs routes and
ports, as per Article 2(4). This will be discussed in Chapter 2.2.4.
Possible voyage combinations involving at least one end of port call involved in a OMR can
be divided into two main categories:
1.

Extra-EU voyages between
●​ an OMR port and a non-EEA port

2.

Intra-EU voyages between
●​
●​
●​
●​
●​

An OMR port and an EEA-port in the same EEA Member State
An OMR port and an EEA-port in a different EEA Member State
Two ports within the same OMR
Two OMR ports of the same EEA Member State
Two OMR ports of different EEA Member States

For Extra-EEA voyages, 50% of the energy used should be included in the scope of this
Regulation, as per Article 2(1)(d). This also applies to voyages between an OMR port and a
non-EEA port:
Article 2(1)(d): one half of the energy used on voyages arriving at or departing from a
port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State, where the previous or the next port
of call is under the jurisdiction of a third country.
For Intra-EEA voyages, 100% of the energy used should be included in the scope of this
Regulation, as per Article 2(1)(b).

​

pg. 46

Article 2(1)(b): the entirety of the energy used on voyages from a port of call under the
jurisdiction of a Member State to a port of call under the jurisdiction of a Member State;
However, Article 2(1)(c) provides specific rules to voyages “departing from” or “arriving at” an
OMR port and supersedes Article 2(1)(b). Only 50% of the energy used in these voyages is
included in the scope of this Regulation.
Article 2(1)(c): notwithstanding point (b), one half of the energy used on voyages
arriving at or departing from a port of call located in an outermost region under the
jurisdiction of a Member State;
This means that a voyage between an OMR port and a Member State port falls under Article
2(1)(c), despite being an Intra-EEA voyage, and only 50% of the energy falls under the
scope of this Regulation. A complete set of examples and the corresponding Article numbers
are listed in Table 10. At the time of publication, Member States notified the Commission of a
list of exempted OMR ports (Article 2(4)). Some examples do not include specific OMR ports
and are shown with grey text, but they are retained in the table to illustrate the functioning of
Article 2(1)(c) once Article 2(4) exemption expires in 2030.

provides this exemption on a permanent basis, while the EU ETS Directive covers the period
up to 31 December 2030 (see EU ETS guidance document n°146). The fuel consumption of
voyages from/to OMR should be monitored and reported. However, from 2031, for the
purpose of calculating the yearly average GHG intensity of energy used on board, the
energy scope will be reduced accordingly.

2.2.2.​

Voyages to ports identified as neighbouring transhipment ports

Similar to the concept used under the MRV/ETS, FuelEU stipulates that stops made by
containerships at a neighbouring container transhipment port, as listed in the relevant
implementing act adopted by the Commission, are excluded from the definition of a port of
call. At the time of writing this document, this act is pending adoption. In the draft available
for public consultation, the following ports were identified as neighbouring container
transhipment ports:
●​ East Port Said, Egypt
●​ Tanger Med, Morocco
This list aligns with the respective list under MRV/ETS (Implementing Regulation (EU)
2023/2297), thereby aligning the definitions of voyages under FuelEU and EU MRV.
Stops made by containerships at the ports identified in the adopted act are considered part
of a voyage. The scope of the voyage and the energy contribution, as per Article 2(1),
depends on the vessel’s last port of call and the next port of call. Consequently, the
respective voyage will always fall under one of the predefined voyage categories, eliminating
the need for specific calculation examples.

2.2.3.​

Small islands - Article 2(3)

Regulatory reference
Article 2(3) of FuelEU allows Member States to request exemptions for the energy used by
ships on specific routes and in ports served by passenger ships, other than cruise ships.
This applies to routes connecting a port of a Member State with small islands of the same
Member State that have a population of fewer than 200,000, as well as the duration of stay
within a port of that island.
Member States should notify the European Commission of these exemption requests, which
will be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. They are subject to a
time limit, expiring no later than 31 December 2029.
The following Member States have requested exemptions for their small islands shown in
Table 12.

The FuelEU approach differs from the EU ETS approach. FuelEU provides for this possible
exemption with an expiration date no later than 31 December 2029, while the EU ETS
directive covers the period up to 31 December 2030 (see EU ETS guidance document
n°155). Additionally, FuelEU exempts only the port of call of the low-populated island, not
both ports of call for the specific voyage. For differences between EU ETS and FuelEU
obligations for specific voyage examples, consult the list of exempted islands under the EU
ETS Directive and FuelEU.
Energy falling under the scope of FuelEU
The energy consumption of these voyages as well as the relevant port of calls, should be
monitored and reported. However, for the purpose of calculating the yearly average GHG
intensity of energy used on board, the energy scope will be reduced accordingly.

2.2.4.​

Voyages between outermost region ports - Article 2(4)

Regulatory reference
In addition to the permanent exemption provided by Article 2(1) of FuelEU (see previous
section), Article 2(4) allows Member States to request exemptions from the regulation’s
scope for specific routes and ports. This applies to the energy used by ships on voyages
between port of calls in OMRs, and during their stay within the ports of call in those ports.
Moreover, all ports of call within the exempted OMR ports are excluded from application of
FuelEU Article 2(1), regardless of previous or next port of call.
Member States should notify the European Commission of these exemption requests, which
will be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the European Union. These
exemptions are subject to a time limit, expiring no later than 31 December 2029.

Public service obligations or public service contracts - Article 2(5) and
2(6)

Articles 2(5) and 2(6) of FuelEU allow Member States to request complete exemptions from
FuelEU for:
●​ Passenger ships performing public service obligations/contracts between a port of a
Member State that does not share a land border with any other Member State and
ports of other Member States.
●​ Specific routes served by passenger ships providing maritime transport services
under EU “cabotage” rules (Regulation (EEC) No 3577/92 under public service
obligations/contracts, operating before 12 October 2023, between the mainland and
an island of the same Member State or the cities of Ceuta and Melilla). For the
purposes of this exemption, the cities of Ceuta and Melilla will be considered as ports
of call located on an island.
Member States should notify the European Commission of these exemption requests, which
will be published by the Commission in the Official Journal of the EU. At the time of writing,
the following Member States have requested exemptions related to public service obligations
and contracts:

Energy falling under the scope of FuelEU
The energy consumption of these voyages, as well as the relevant port of calls, should be
monitored and reported. However, for the purpose of calculating the yearly average GHG
intensity of energy used on board, the energy scope will be reduced accordingly.
Even though exempted voyages and port stays do not contribute to the FuelEU energy
scope, fuels used during these voyages and port stays may still be allocated to the annual
FuelEU scope of energy. This applies if there are voyages or port stays in the Reporting
Period that fall under the FuelEU scope. For more information on fuel allocation, see
Chapter 2.5.

2.3.​ Data Aggregation Categories
Annex I to Implementing Regulation (EU) 2024/2027 provides the template for the FuelEU
report. Part E of the Annex details different aggregations for energy consumption data. For
the purpose of submitting the FuelEU report, shipping companies should ensure that the
monitoring and reporting process accurately captures the following categories.64
Aggregation of fuel consumed at sea for all voyages:
●​ Between ports under a Member State’s jurisdiction
●​ Departing from ports under a Member State’s jurisdiction
●​ To ports under a Member State’s jurisdiction

2.4.​ Mass of Fuel used for Establishing GHG Intensity of
Energy used Onboard a Ship
Annex I of the FuelEU provides:
The [Mi] mass of fuel must be determined using the amount reported under Regulation
(EU) 2015/757 for voyages within the scope of this Regulation, based on the monitoring
methodology chosen by the company.
To determine the fuel quantity consumed, the MRV Maritime Regulation65 allows three
different approaches: method A, method B or method C.

65

For more information, see Regulation (EU) 2015/757.

​
The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission,

​

pg. 56

Additionally, for the purpose of determining GHG emissions directly, a measurement-based
approach (method D) may be used. In such cases, fuel consumption should still be reported,
which can be done through back-calculation using emissions and the CO2 emission factor.
However, it is beneficial to use a second monitoring method to verify the results of the
primary method. Generally, back-calculation should be considered a secondary option. It is
recommended to use a supplementary method (method A, method B, method C) to directly
determine fuel consumption utilized in reporting.
The above quoted definition provided in FuelEU Annex I implies that fuel quantities
reported for MRV Regulation and FuelEU should be consistent, to limit the
administrative burden imposed on shipping companies, verifiers and competent authorities.
Fuel quantities should be grouped according to the categories indicated in Section 2.3 and
as set out by Implementing Regulation 2023/2449, which provides the template for the MRV
Emission Report.
As outlined in earlier sections, FuelEU may not apply to all energy used on monitored
voyages. Voyage-specific and ship-specific deductions will lead to differences between the
mass of fuel reported for both monitoring schemes and the mass of fuel used to establish the
GHG intensity of the energy used on board a ship, to calculate the compliance balance and
to determine FuelEU penalties. For example, for a vessel performing Extra-EEA or voyages
within the scope of any of the exemptions described in Section 2.2, the mass of fuel used for
calculating the greenhouse gas intensity will be reduced according to the actual FuelEU
energy scope. Subsequent calculation steps, illustrated in Figure 3, demonstrate how input
data representing the fuel consumption reporting for EU MRV purposes is used in FuelEU
calculations.
Figure 3. Illustration of subsequent FuelEU calculation steps and order of calculations

2.5.​ Allocation of Fuels
FuelEU does not prescribe a specific methodology for allocating fuels to complete the
energy scope under Article 2. The European Commission Questions and Answers on
FuelEU webpage66 states that allocation of fuels is possible in the calculation of the
contribution to the GHG intensity of the covered energy. In absence of a defined
methodology in the legislative text and based on the interpretation in the Questions and
Answers, it is understood that the fuels used on different types of voyages or port calls can
be freely allocated to meet the total energy scope within one calendar year, provided they

have been reported under the MRV Regulation. Thus, allocation can consider the
intensity associated with different fuel types across any fuel class, based on their
respective emission factors, as well as the emission factors linked to different fuel
consumers.
For example, LNG used in multiple onboard engines with different slippage coefficients can
be allocated according to their intensity. Since reporting of fuels under the MRV Regulation
and FuelEU is on component basis, it is also possible to de-couple component blends and
allocate them to FuelEU energy scope separately. However, it is not permitted to report fuel
consumption of a fuel blend in proportions different from the actual proportion of components
in a fuel blend, even if the amounts of fuel under each component of the blend can be
allocated freely (e.g. the bio-diesel component of a B30 blend with fossil fuel oil can be
allocated independently from the fossil fuel component).
Lastly, sources of energy other than traditional fuels (such as electricity) can be also
allocated to the FuelEU energy scope. Electricity may form part of the energy used on
Extra-EEA voyages, in the case of use of OPS during an intermediate stop forming part of a
FuelEU/MRV voyage, or in case of hybrid or other innovative propulsion systems.

2.6.​ Step-by-Step Guidance for Extra-EEA Voyages
This Section includes a total of four examples aiming to clarify calculation principles where,
unlike the examples in Section 1.4, a portion of energy used throughout voyages and port of
calls contribute to the energy falling under the scope of FuelEU.
The following are calculation steps specific to such scenarios:
1.​ Determine energy used per voyage/port of call using mass of each fuel type and
respective LCVs. Add consumption of electrical energy where applicable.
2.​ For each voyage/port of call, calculate the energy in scope of the Regulation, as
per Article 2(1) and consider exemptions given through Articles 2(3), 2(4), 2(5), 2(6).
Add the individual leg contribution to determine total FuelEU energy scope.
3.​ Allocate different sources of energy considered under point 1, until FuelEU
energy scope is covered. Using LCV, obtain fuel mass per each respective fuel type
and energy from electricity allocated to FuelEU energy scope.
4.​ Calculate GHG intensity and FuelEU Compliance Balance using fuel masses
determined under point 3) as well as energy from electricity, if applicable, by using
principles outlined in Chapter 1.

Example 1: General case
Figure 4 illustrates the most beneficial allocation of fuels to the FuelEU energy scope. In the
assumed scenario, the vessel performed several Extra-EEA voyages, which, as per Article
2(1)(d), reduced the energy in scope of FuelEU. The overall voyage pattern in the Reporting
Period year resulted in approximately a 40% reduction in the FuelEU energy scope (from
58,105 GJ to 35,000 GJ). Considering the fuel mix, which includes energy from OPS,
certified bio-diesel, MDO, LFO and HFO, the most favourable fuels are used first in the
calculation of GHG intensity. This increases the impact of using low-GHG-intensity energy

sources on the compliance balance, effectively incentivizing the introduction of such energy
sources into the energy mix up to the amount of energy in scope of FuelEU.
Figure 4. Illustration of fuel mix for voyages/port of calls in scope of FuelEU Regulation in calendar year and most
beneficial fuel allocation to FuelEU energy scope

Fuels used during voyages outside the scope of MRV and FuelEU reporting cannot be
allocated to the FuelEU energy scope (e.g., fuels used on voyages between two
non-Member State ports). However, fuels used during voyages and port calls exempted
under Articles 2(3), 2(4), 2(5), and 2(6) may be allocated to the FuelEU energy scope as
long as there are other voyages and port calls that contribute to the FuelEU energy scope
source (e.g., intra-EU voyages within the same calendar year).
For all practical purposes, all examples in this document assume allocation of fuels to the
FuelEU energy scope is optimized to the benefit of the ship's compliance balance.

Example 2: LNG used on Extra-EEA voyages with different slippage coefficients
This example serves to illustrate the allocation of fuels to the FuelEU energy scope for a
vessel performing a voyage from a non-Member State port to a Member State port and a
return voyage to the same non-Member State port. In the assumed scenario, the vessel
uses LNG for its main engines, auxiliary engines and boiler. Additionally, MDO and HFO are
used as pilot fuel and during diesel-only mode operations within port of call.

The Well-to-Wake GHG intensity for the voyage sequence, calculated in accordance with
Chapter 1, using fuel mass determined per each fuel, is equal to 75.93 gCO2eq/MJ.
The principles presented in this example can be directly applied to bio-methane and
e-methane scenarios. The overall principle applies to any voyage sequence where the fuel
mix consists of fuels with different GHG intensities. It is important to note that allocation has
been applied as if the three legs (extra-EU,port of call, extra-EU) were the only legs within
the scope of FuelEU in the calendar year. If there were more legs within the scope of the
Regulation, the most beneficial fuel allocation might differ. For instance, if the vessel
consumed bio-methane on other voyages and within port calls, bio-methane could partially
or completely displace fossil fuels from the FuelEU energy fuel mix.

67

As per EU ETS and MRV guidance document no.1, Chapter 7.4.2: Where default slippage coefficients are not listed for a specific emission
source class, companies should apply a slippage coefficient of zero.
68
FuelEU energy contribution should be understood as the energy contribution from each fuel type towards the FuelEU energy. Where equal to
zero, specific fuel type is not taken into account in the GHG intensity calculations due to application of the most beneficial allocation principles.
69
FuelEU mass contribution should be understood as the mass of each fuel type [Mi] taken into consideration for the purpose of establishing
greenhouse gas intensity of energy used onboard a ship.

Example 3: Sustainable biofuel used on EEA-outgoing voyage
This example illustrates a scenario where a vessel arrives at a Member State port from a
non-Member State port and then departs from the Member State port to another
non-Member State port. In this scenario, the vessel uses fossil fuels (MDO and HFO) en
route to the Member State port and within the port of call. However, on the outgoing leg, a
biofuel bunkered in the Member State port, fulfilling the certification criteria of FuelEU Article
10, is used. The WtW GHG intensity of the biofuel batch is assumed in this example to be
18.6 gCO2eq/MJ and LCV equal to 37 MJ/kg. It is noteworthy that the bio-diesel could be a
component in a physical blend (e.g., B30), in which case the fossil and biofuel components
are to be reported separately and allocated independently, similarly to how it is calculated in
this example.

Considering that biofuel is used on a voyage where the energy is not entirely applicable to
the FuelEU energy scope, this low-GHG intensity fuel displaces other fuels used on the
voyage arriving at the Member State port and fuels used within the port call under the scope
of the Regulation. This example illustrates a scenario where the entirety of sustainable
biofuel used by the ship is not allocated to FuelEU energy scope. While such a scenario
might not be preferable to a shipping company, it may occur if the FuelEU energy scope is
relatively small compared to used quantities of low GHG intensity fuels. As mentioned in
Example 2, the allocation is applied as if the three legs were the only legs in scope of the
Regulation in the calendar year. If there are other voyages within the scope of the Regulation
in the same year, the remaining mass of biofuel may be allocated to the FuelEU energy
scope to displace fuels of higher GHG intensity. If this is not the case, it is not possible to
‘bank’ the surplus from the biofuel mass to a different calendar year or pool it with another
ship.

The Well-to-Wake GHG intensity for the voyage sequence, calculated in accordance with
Chapter 1, using fuel mass determined per each fuel, is equal to 18.6 gCO2eq/MJ.
The principles used in this example apply similarly to voyages that arrive at or depart from a
port of call located in an OMR under the jurisdiction of a Member State, following Article
2(1)(c). Since most, if not all, OMR ports are covered by Article 2(4), a separate example is
not provided to illustrate a voyage applicable for a 50% energy scope deduction as per
Article 2(1)(c).

Example 4: Voyages excluded under Article 2(3), 2(4), 2(5) or 2(6)
To further clarify fuel allocation, it is necessary to illustrate that all fuels reported under the
scope of the MRV Regulation can be allocated to meet the total FuelEU energy scope within
one calendar year. In the constructed example, a voyage between two OMR ports excluded
under FuelEU Article 2(4) is the first leg considered in the calculation, followed by a port of
call in the OMR port, which is also excluded under Article 2(4). The last leg in the example is
a voyage between OMR port and Member State port, which is an intra-EU voyage,
nevertheless covered by Article 2(1)(c). For better understanding of the principles, fuel used
throughout a fully exempted voyage and port of call is assumed to be a biofuel fulfilling the
certification criteria of FuelEU Article 10, while fuels used on a voyage where 50% energy is
covered are fossil fuels. The WtW GHG intensity of the biofuel batch is assumed in this
example to be 18.6 gCO2eq/MJ and LCV equal to 37 MJ/kg.

The Well-to-Wake GHG intensity for the voyage sequence, calculated in accordance with
Chapter 1, using fuel mass determined per each fuel, is equal to 18.6 gCO2eq/MJ.
The resulting FuelEU fuel mix demonstrates that the use of low-GHG intensity fuels on
exempted voyages is incentivized equally to any other voyages, with the FuelEU energy
scope being covered by bio-diesel.
Principles used in this example apply similarly to voyages or port calls exempted under
Articles 2(3), 2(5), and 2(6) of the FuelEU. Given the limited number of ships benefiting from
these Articles, specific examples are not provided.
In cases where vessels benefit from Articles 2(3), 2(4), 2(5) or 2(6) for most or all voyages
and port calls within a calendar year, as explained in Example 3, it is not possible to bank a
surplus of low-GHG intensity fuel to another calendar year or share it between ships if the
FuelEU energy scope is relatively small and does not accommodate the entirety of low-GHG
intensity fuel mass.
FuelEU applies a differentiated approach depending on whether a voyage is Intra-EEA or
Extra-EEA, and whether it involves OMRs or small island ports exempted under the
regulation. This creates opportunities for strategic fuel allocation and places emphasis on
accurate reporting and careful interpretation of exemptions. Building on this foundation, the
next chapter examines how specific technologies and fuel types, such as wind propulsion
and onshore power, influence a ship’s compliance balance under FuelEU.

3.​ Chapter 3: Technology-specific Calculations
3.1.​ Introduction
This Chapter is focused on technology-specific FuelEU compliance balance results, i.e.,
the impact of those technologies on the yearly compliance balance (in mass gCO2eq), as the
measure of a ship’s over- or under-compliance under FuelEU (see Section 1.3). The specific
technologies and fuels covered include:
●​ Ice classed vessel and navigation in ice: Calculation of fuel consumption
adjustments;
●​ Wind-assisted propulsion: Effects of reward factors and operational fuel
consumption;
●​ Biomethane: Impact of negative emissions on compliance;
●​ Low-carbon and recycled fuels: Future eligibility and main differences from
Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin (RFNBOs or e-fuels);
●​ Zero Emission Technologies at berth (Annex III technologies): Impact of using
Zero Emission Technologies at berth on the final yearly compliance balance.
This document does not include calculations or demonstrations related to GHG or
sustainability certification of marine bunker fuels. Current calculations start with the GHG
emission value of fuels, in gCO2eq/MJ, as determined at point of delivery to the ship
(bunkering) and as stated on the Proof of Sustainability (PoS) or equivalent document of
compliance provided to the ship. For guidance on certification requirements of fuels related
to FuelEU and EU ETS compliance, refer to the SAPS WS2 document titled 'Report on
Marine Fuels Certification Procedures to support implementation of FuelEU.'70
Finally, any examples and conclusions in this Chapter are illustrative and non-exhaustive.
They are intended only as guidance for a shipping company to conduct its own more
comprehensive calculations and analyses following FuelEU calculation principles and
other considerations. This document does not constitute an endorsement or
recommendation for adopting particular technologies.

3.2.​ Key Concepts and Definitions
Below is a list of concepts and definitions used throughout this Chapter, as per the official
text of the FuelEU regulation71 (except otherwise noted):
●​ ‘Compliance balance’ refers to the measure of a ship’s over- or under-compliance
with the limits for the yearly average GHG intensity of the energy used on board by a
ship or the RFNBO subtarget. This calculation is performed in accordance with Part

3.3.​ Technology-specific Calculations
3.3.1.​

Ice class and ice navigation

Annex IV of FuelEU provides that:
for any ship having the ice class IC, IB, IA or IA Super or an equivalent ice class, the
company may request, until 31 December 2034, to exclude the additional energy
consumption, due to sailing in ice conditions. For any ship having the ice class IA or IA
Super or an equivalent ice class, the company may request to exclude the additional
energy consumption, due to the technical characteristics of the ship.
The fuel consumption of voyages by ships with ice class IC, IB, IA or IA Super, or an
equivalent ice class, should be monitored and reported. However, for the purpose of
calculating the yearly average GHG intensity of energy used on board, the energy scope will
be reduced according to Annex V of FuelEU. This derogation is in the form of an adjusted
amount of fuel mass under the scope of FuelEU targets, awarded to these ships since they
consume more fuel navigating in ice compared to periods sailing in open water. An additional
derogation is awarded if the vessel has ice class IA or IA Super, or an equivalent ice class,
as these vessels are at a disadvantage from an energy efficiency design perspective. Both
derogations are expressed as a combined deduction in the mass of fuels that fall under the
scope of FuelEU calculation (Annex I and IV), as described in the methodology of Annex V
of the Regulation.
To deduct a mass of fuels from FuelEU scope due to ice class and navigation in ice
(combined), an adjusted mass of fuel Mi,A is calculated according to Annex V of the
Regulation. This adjusted mass is then used instead of the mass of fuels Mi when
calculating a ship’s GHG intensity according to Annex I, as well as in calculating the
compliance balance and FuelEU penalty according to Annex IV of the Regulation.
Calculations Example
In this section, a calculation example is provided for a ship with ice class 1A Super
undertaking a 2-day voyage of 600 nautical miles, with 75 nautical miles navigated under ice
conditions. It is assumed that the vessel consumes 7.5 tonnes of LFO (ISO 8217 Grades
RMA to RMD) while navigating in ice, out of a total voyage consumption of 51.25 tonnes of
LFO in both ice and open-water conditions. These fuel consumption amounts and distances
are assumed to be entirely within the scope of the Regulation, as further explained in the
note on Extra-EEA voyages.

Note on Extra-EEA voyages:
The starting point of the Regulation’s Annex V “Calculation of adjusted mass of fuel for ice
navigation” is the energy used and distance sailed “within the scope of this Regulation”,
according to definitions in Annex V:
"Mi, voyages, total" (and "Mi,voyages,ice conditions") denotes the mass of fuel i consumed for all
voyages (or for "Mi,voyages,ice conditions" for sailing in ice conditions) within the scope of
this Regulation.
“Dtotal“ (and “Dice conditions”) denotes the aggregated annual distance travelled (or for
“Dice conditions” when sailing in ice conditions) within the scope of this Regulation.
The key aspect in these definitions is the expression, "within the scope of this
Regulation", which limits the scope of Annex V calculations to 50% of the energy use and
distance sailed between EEA and non-EEA port calls, as well as all other exemptions from
the "scope of this Regulation", as provided in Article 2 (Scope) of the Regulation.
Therefore, for the current calculation example, all fuel (energy) amounts and distances
sailed are already limited to the scope of the Regulation, i.e. after deducting all energy
used and distance sailed that is not within scope of the Regulation, and allocations
thereof, as illustrated in Chapter 2 (Extra-EEA Voyages).
Example: for voyages between EEA and non-EEA port calls, Dtotal is already 50% of the
total distance travelled, and Dice is also 50% of the distance travelled in ice conditions.
Same for Mi, voyages, total and Mi,voyages,ice conditions , which are each 50% of the total and “in ice”
fuel consumption (respectively) on voyages between EEA and non-EEA port calls.

Table 24 shows a breakdown of the relevant numbers needed for the calculation, with the
corresponding notation used in Annex V where appropriate. Although the notation from
Annex V is used throughout, the calculations are presented in a different order than in Annex
V for simplicity of understanding. In this document the formulas are presented in the order
required for calculating the results.

The steps to calculate the adjusted mass of fuel are outlined. Example calculations are

Step 1: Calculate energy used in ice and open water.
Energy for each sailing condition is calculated using the tonnes of fuel and corresponding
Lower Calorific Value (LCV).
𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 = 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑟𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠(𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠) × 1, 000, 000 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝐿𝐹𝑂 (𝑀𝐽/𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑚))

𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝑖𝑛 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 (𝑀𝐽)
𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 = 2, 101, 250 − 307, 500
= 1, 793, 750 𝑀𝐽

Step 2: Calculate the adjusted energy in ice conditions.
The adjusted energy in ice conditions represents the baseline energy in open water that the
vessel sailing in ice would have used if it had been sailing in open waters. In other words,
this is the reference energy that the ship would have consumed over the distance sailed in
ice, Dice conditions, had the ship sailed in open water. This baseline is calculated as:

Note on cases where a ship navigates in ice throughout the entire Reporting Period:
In the event that a ship sails under ice conditions for the entire duration of the Reporting
Period, the formula Evoyages, ice conditions, adjusted cannot be computed due to a “divided by zero”
error. This occurs because the total distance would be under ice conditions, i.e. Dtotal = Dice
, and fuel consumption occurs only under ice conditions, i.e. Evoyages, total = Evoyages, ice

conditions

, resulting in:
𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, 𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑 = 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒 × ( 𝐸𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟/𝐷𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 ) =
= 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒 × (𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠) / (𝐷𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠) =
= 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒 × (𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙) / (𝐷𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐷𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙) =
= 𝐷𝑖𝑐𝑒 × ( 0 ) / ( 0 ) = 𝑒𝑟𝑟𝑜𝑟: 𝑑𝑖𝑣𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑑 𝑏𝑦 𝑧𝑒𝑟𝑜.

While the situation of only sailing in ice is admittedly rare, the Regulation does not
currently provide a solution for this possibility. Some potential solutions might include (if
accepted by the verifier) using additional data to prove the increased fuel consumption of
the vessel due to sailing in ice conditions versus open water conditions, by referring to
previous Reporting Periods. Alternatively, in extreme cases, the ship could be re-routed to
perform open water navigation at least once during the Reporting Period.

Step 3: Calculate the additional energy due to ice conditions
The additional energy due to ice conditions, which is ultimately to be deducted from the total
fuel consumption to account for the excess consumption from navigating in ice, is calculated
as the total energy minus the open water energy and the adjusted ice condition energy
(open-water baseline for the distance sailed in ice). As set out in Annex V, there is a cap on
the amount of energy that can be deducted, which is presented as a cap on the additional
ice condition energy, and is set at 1.3 times the open water energy.

𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠,𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠,𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠,𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠,𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑
= 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑒𝑛𝑒𝑟𝑔𝑦 𝑓𝑟𝑜𝑚 𝑠𝑎𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑖𝑛 𝑖𝑐𝑒 (𝑀𝐽)
where 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 cannot be higher than 1. 3 * 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
Which means that if
𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, 𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑 > 1. 3 × 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
the calculation in this example yields:
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 − 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠, 𝑎𝑑𝑗𝑢𝑠𝑡𝑒𝑑
= 2, 101, 250 − 1, 793, 750 − 256 250
= 51, 250 𝑀𝐽
We should also check that this result satisfies:
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 < 1. 3 × 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟
and in this example, this is confirmed:
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 51, 250 𝑀𝐽, which is < 1. 3 × 1, 793, 750 = 2, 331, 875 𝑀𝐽
Since the condition 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 < 1. 3 × 𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑛 𝑤𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑟 is satisfied, calculation may
proceed, with the result:
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 = 51, 250 𝑀𝐽

Step 4: Calculate the additional energy due to ice class
Once the additional energy due to ice navigation is calculated, we can proceed to calculate
the additional energy due to ice class. This is because only 5% of the remaining energy,
after deducting ice navigation energy, is allowed to be deducted.
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 = 0. 05 × (𝐸𝑣𝑜𝑦𝑎𝑔𝑒𝑠, 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠)
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 = 0. 05 × (2, 101, 250 − 51, 250)
= 102, 500 𝑀𝐽

Step 5: Calculate the total additional energy due to ice.
The total additional energy due to ice class and navigation in ice is the sum of both ice-class
and navigation-in-ice deductions:
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 = 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑙𝑎𝑠𝑠 + 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑑𝑢𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑐𝑜𝑛𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠
𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 = 102, 500 + 51, 250

= 153, 750 𝑀𝐽

Step 6: Adjust mass of fuel
Finally this additional energy is removed from the different fuels used during the year:
𝑀𝑖, 𝐴 = 𝑀𝑖 − 𝐸𝑖, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 /(𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖)

Where Mi is the mass of fuel (i) consumed. In this example, for LFO:
𝑀𝑖, 𝐴 = 𝑀𝐿𝐹𝑂, 𝐴 = 𝑀𝐿𝐹𝑂 − 𝐸𝐿𝐹𝑂, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 / (𝐿𝐶𝑉)𝐿𝐹𝑂)

Ei, additional ice should be allocated as a share of Eadditional ice to each fuel. In the current example,
as there is only one fuel type, all of the additional ice energy Eadditional ice is deducted from this
fuel:
𝐸𝐿𝐹𝑂, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 = 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒
𝑀𝐴 = 𝑀𝐿𝐹𝑂 − 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 / (𝐿𝐶𝑉𝐿𝐹𝑂)
= 51. 25 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠 − 153, 750 𝑀𝐽 / (0. 041 𝑀𝐽/𝑔 * 1, 000, 000 𝑔/𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒)
= 47. 5 𝑡𝑜𝑛𝑛𝑒𝑠

Note on cases with multiple fuel types:
It should be noted that the above example is simplified, as most vessels consume more
than one type of fuel. In such cases, the final calculation of adjusted mass of fuel
(𝑀𝑖, 𝐴 = 𝑀𝑖 − 𝐸𝑖, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 / 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖) allows shipping companies to allocate the deduction
due to ice class and navigation to the fuels with highest GHG intensity, provided there
is sufficient
fuel amount Mi to subtract from as − 𝐸𝑖, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑡𝑜 𝑖𝑐𝑒 / 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖. This is
expressed in Annex V of the Regulation as:
The company shall allocate the total additional ice energy 𝐸𝑖 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 to
the different fuels i used during the year, with the following conditions:
Σ 𝐸𝑖 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 = 𝐸𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒
For each fuel i,
𝐸𝑖, 𝑎𝑑𝑑𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑖𝑐𝑒 ≤ 𝑀𝑖×𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖
This creates a further incentive for the uptake of low-GHG intensity fuels when operating
an ice-classed vessel and for vessels navigating in ice.

Finally, in order to calculate the effects on FuelEU compliance, the adjusted mass of fuel Mi,A
is applied to the calculation of GHG intensity and compliance balance formulas of Annexes I
and IV, respectively (see Chapter 1). In Table 25, an example of the final voyage result
demonstrates the benefits in terms of compliance balance and FuelEU penalty for the
current example. As a result of applying the ice derogation, the compliance deficit and
respective FuelEU penalty are both reduced, saving around 200€ in FuelEU penalties
related to that single voyage: a reduced penalty of €2,564, instead of a baseline €2,767
penalty without ice derogation.

3.3.2. Wind-assisted propulsion
FuelEU rewards wind-assisted propulsion by considering a reward factor fwind. This factor is
applied in the GHG intensity formula (Equation 1 of Annex I of the FuelEU) which helps bring
the actual GHG intensity of a ship closer or beyond the ship GHG intensity targets set in
Article 4.
An additional positive consequence of installing wind-assisted propulsion for non-compliant
vessels under FuelEU (e.g., a ship running solely on fossil fuels or not using enough low
GHG fuels to reach the GHG intensity targets) is a reduction in fuel consumption during
operation. This results in a lower compliance deficit and a correspondingly lower FuelEU
penalty.
The reward factor 𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 as set out in Annex I is as follows:

Mid-year installation
The reward factor is calculated at the end of the Reporting Period based on verified
documentation available on 31 December of the Reporting Period. To be eligible for the
reward factor, the EEDI/EEXI technical file should be updated and verified to include the
calculation of wind-assisted propulsion contribution. In the case of mid-year installation, the
same reward factor is applied for the entire year. Currently FuelEU only specifies in Annex I
that:

GHG intensity index of the ship is (...) calculated by multiplying the result of Equation (1)
by the reward factor

and no further detailed methodology is provided on how to handle periods when
wind-assisted propulsion installation had not yet been verified within the Reporting Period
according to EEDI for new ships (IMO resolution MEPC.364(79)) or the 2021 guidelines on
the method of calculation of the attained EEXI (IMO resolution MEPC.333(76)). Therefore,
the reward factor applies to the entire Equation 1 of Annex I of FuelEU, meaning the entire
Reporting Period (see calculation Example 1).

3.3.3 Wind-assisted propulsion examples
Table 26 presents three scenarios that demonstrate the impact of wind-assisted propulsion
on FuelEU compliance balance, GHG intensity, and associated penalties. These examples
vary by installation timing, reward, and propulsion, illustrating how different design and
operational choices impact compliance outcomes.

Example 1: Mid-year installation
In this example a ship is retrofitted with wind-assisted propulsion, with the installation taking
place in July 2025. The EEDI/EEXI technical file is updated to include information on the
wind-assisted propulsion and it is approved in July 2025. According to the EEDI77 and EEXI78
technical files the 𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 900𝑘𝑊 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 7, 000𝑘𝑊.
Reward factor is calculated as:
𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 /𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 900/7, 000 = 0. 129
0. 1 ≤ 𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 /𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 < 0. 15
leading to
𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 0. 97

The same reward factor is applied for the entire Reporting Period, in this case, the year
2025, even if the installation takes place (and is verified) in the middle of the Reporting
Period.

For demonstration purposes, the ship in this calculation example consumes the following
amounts during one full Reporting Period as a baseline case without wind-assisted
propulsion.
Fuel consumption baseline:
●​ 12,000 tonnes Heavy Fuel Oil (HFO) used in main engines for propulsion, and
●​ 1,400 tonnes Marine Gas Oil (MDO/MGO) used for auxiliary power.
For the same ship with installed wind-assisted propulsion, the following assumption is
made’ a reduction in HFO consumption is achieved in the second half of year 2025, i.e., after
the installation. In this example, the reduction is estimated at approximately 12.5% savings
for half of the year. Note that this is an arbitrary value and that actual fuel consumption in
operation will depend on various factors related to the ship, operational profile, and weather
conditions on the actual route.
Fuel consumption with savings from wind-assisted propulsion:
●​ 11,250 tonnes HFO used in main engines for propulsion, and
●​ 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO used for auxiliary power.
Note on Example 1 in Table 26: Where it is noted that the compliance balance improves
by 1,490 tonnes CO2eq due to lower achieved GHG intensity relative to the baseline
without wind-assisted propulsion (91.64 → 88.88 gCO2eq/MJ). This improvement is the
result of applying the reward factor fwind. Since the achieved GHG intensity is below the
2025 target (89.34 gCO2eq/MJ), there is no FuelEU penalty associated with this
wind-assisted propulsion example, resulting in a 100% reduction in the penalty. It is
noteworthy that the reduction in yearly fuel consumption has a negative effect on the
amount of compliance surplus generated: 234 tonnes CO2eq of compliance balance is
generated in this example, which is lower than in a case without a reduction in operational
fuel consumption in the baseline (i.e., if the wind-assisted propulsion equipment was not
operational and HFO consumption was 12,000 tonnes). In the case of higher baseline
consumption, the compliance surplus would instead be 245 tonnes CO2eq, but this would
come at the cost of higher fuel consumption (12,000 tonnes instead of 11,250 tonnes).

Example 2: Full reporting period
A ship has an approved EEDI/EEXI technical file for a full Reporting Period. The ship is
equipped with engine power limitation (EPL) and wind-assisted propulsion.
According to the EEDI/EEXI technical file, 𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 is 1,100kW and the 𝑃𝑀𝐸 is 10,000 kW. The
ship is equipped with EPL at 9,000kW. Therefore the 𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 considered is:
​

​

​

𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 0. 75 * 𝑃𝑀𝐸, 𝐿𝐼𝑀 = 0. 75 * 9, 000𝑘𝑊 = 6, 750𝑘𝑊.

The reward factor is calculated:
𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 /𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 1, 100𝑘𝑊 / (0. 75 * 9, 000 𝑘𝑊) = 1, 100𝑘𝑊 / 6, 750 𝑘𝑊 = 0. 163

0. 15 ≤ 𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 /𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 0. 163
𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 0. 95

For demonstration purposes, a baseline ship without wind-assisted propulsion consumes
the same amount of fuel as in the previous example (12,000 tonnes HFO and 1,400 tonnes
MGO).
For the same ship with installed wind-assisted propulsion, it is assumed that some HFO
consumption reduction is achieved throughout the entire year. In this example, the reduction
is estimated at approximately 15% savings for the entire year. As with the first example, this
is an arbitrary value, actual values depend on a number of factors related to the ship,
operational profile, and weather conditions on the actual route.
Fuel consumption with savings from wind-assisted propulsion:
●​ 10,200 tonnes Heavy Fuel Oil, HFO, used in main engines for propulsion, and
●​ 1,400 tonnes Marine Gas Oil, MDO/MGO, used for auxiliary power.
Note on Example 2 in Table 26: Where it is noted that the compliance balance improves
by 2,341 tonnes CO2eq due to the lower achieved GHG intensity relative to the baseline
without wind-assisted propulsion (91.64 → 87.04 gCO2eq/MJ). This improvement is the
result of applying the reward factor fwind. Since the achieved GHG intensity is below the
2025 target (89.34 gCO2eq/MJ), there is no FuelEU penalty associated with this
wind-assisted propulsion example, resulting in a 100% reduction in the penalty.
As with the first example, the reduction in yearly fuel consumption has a negative
effect on the amount of compliance surplus generated: 1,086 tonnes of CO2eq
compliance balance is generated in this example, which is lower than in a case without a
reduction in operational fuel consumption in the baseline (i.e. if the wind-assisted
propulsion equipment was not operational and HFO consumption was 12,000 tonnes). In
the case of higher baseline consumption, the compliance surplus would instead be 1,245
tonnes CO2eq, but this would come at the cost of a higher fuel consumption (12,000
tonnes instead of 10,200 tonnes).

Example 3: Non-conventional propulsion
The ship has non-conventional propulsion (diesel-electric) and is therefore exempted from
reaching the EEDI/EEXI target, but the ship still needs to generate and submit an
EEDI/EEDI technical file for verification. Thus, following the same principles and verification
as would have been required for EEDI/EEXI target, the power used for propulsion is in this
example 7,000kW, and the respective reference vessel speed is 16kn. Also, the Pwind at a
ship speed of 16kn is 400 kW in this example.
Calculation of the reward factor is as follows:
𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 7, 000 𝑘𝑊, 𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 400 𝑘𝑊

0. 05 ≤ 𝑃𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 /𝑃𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑝 = 0. 057 < 0. 1
𝑓𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑 = 0. 99

For demonstration purposes, a baseline ship without wind-assisted propulsion consumes
the same amounts as in the previous example (12,000 tonnes HFO and 1,400 tonnes MGO).
It is assumed that with wind-assisted propulsion, a reduction in HFO consumption is
achieved throughout the year. In this example, the reduction is estimated at approximately
7.5%. As with previous examples this is an arbitrary value, actual values will rely on various
factors related to the ship, its operational profile and weather conditions on the actual route.
Fuel consumption with savings from wind-assisted propulsion:
●​ 11,100 tonnes Heavy Fuel Oil, HFO, used in main engines for propulsion, and
●​ 1,400 tonnes Marine Gas Oil, MDO/MGO, used for auxiliary power.
Example 3 results in Table 26 show that the compliance balance improves by 554 tonnes
CO2eq due to lower achieved GHG intensity relative to the baseline without wind-assisted
propulsion (91.64 → 90.71 gCO2eq/MJ). This improvement is attributed to the application of
the reward factor fwind. However, the achieved GHG intensity is not compliant with the 2025
target (89.34 gCO2eq/MJ), resulting in a compliance deficit of -701 tonnes CO2eq and a
FuelEU penalty of ~€ 0.45 million. Despite having a penalty, it is significantly lower than the
baseline penalty without wind-assisted propulsion (~€0.8 million), due to the combined
effect of the reward factor fwind and reduced operational fuel consumption. The
reduction in yearly fuel consumption positively impacts the compliance deficit,
decreasing it by 54 tonnes CO2eq compared to the baseline scenario without operational
wind-assisted propulsion equipment and with HFO consumption of 12,000 tonnes. In such a
scenario with higher consumption (wind-assisted propulsion installed, but not in use), the
compliance deficit would be -755 tonnes CO2eq, leading to a higher FuelEU penalty of
~€0.487 million (example 3.2.3 with 12,000 tonnes HFO / year), instead of ~€0.452 million
(example 3.2.3 with 11,100 tonnes HFO / year).

3.4. Biomethane: Negative or Zero WtT Emissions
FuelEU recognizes that biogas can be utilized to meet a ship’s GHG intensity reduction
targets.79 “Biogas” is defined as gaseous fuels produced from biomass, which can be purified
to natural gas quality, resulting in biomethane.80 Biomethane can then be further liquified to
produce liquified biomethane, or “Bio-LNG” as it is called in the FuelEU, using the same

79

Article 10(1a) of Regulation (EU) 2023/1805. The biogas must derive from waste and residues from Annex IX Part A of Directive (EU)
2018/2001, and not from food/feed crops.

liquefaction process as fossil-based natural gas to LNG. Bio-LNG, like all non-fossil fuels,
should be certified under a voluntary scheme recognized by the European Commission.81
Bio-LNG can be certified as having zero or negative well-to-wake emission intensity. Vessel
operators can account for Bio-LNG with zero or negative well-to-wake emission intensity
towards their vessel’s GHG intensity reduction target. Therefore, guidance on how to apply
calculations for Bio-LNG with zero or negative well-to-wake emission intensity within the
context of FuelEU is deemed useful.
In the context of FuelEU, the E value is used, and this value can be negative. The
well-to-tank GHG emission factor CO2eq,wtt for Bio-LNG will apply a deduction of CfCO2 (as
stated in Annex II of FuelEU), which will be subtracted from the E value presented in the
PoS, yielding:
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺 = 𝐸 (𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺) − 𝐶𝑓𝐶𝑂2/𝐿𝐶𝑉(𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺)

This deduction is intended to offset the biogenic CO2 combustion emissions of Bio-LNG,
resulting in net-zero emissions from a biogenic carbon perspective.

3.4.1 Biomethane examples
The following examples demonstrate how Biomethane with negative or zero well-to-wake
GHG intensity, used across different engine types, affects compliance balance and FuelEU
penalties.

Example 1: Vessel uses bio-LNG (-15 gCO2eq/MJ) - DF Otto medium speed
A vessel uses Bio-LNG in a dual-fuel (DF) Otto-cycle medium speed engine. The
biomethane was produced from manure. Based on the proof of sustainability (an example
value is presented here for demonstration purpose only, not corresponding to any actual
product nor any default value), the following GHG emissions according to EU RED
certification are obtained:
𝐸 (𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺) =

− 15. 00 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒/𝑀𝐽, ​

Note: the Bio-LNG GHG intensity value is an example for the purpose of
demonstrating the calculations.
𝐶𝑓𝐶𝑂2/𝐿𝐶𝑉 (𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺) = (2. 750 𝑔𝐶𝑂2/𝑔𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙 / 0. 050 𝑀𝐽/𝑔𝐹𝑢𝑒𝑙) = 55. 00 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒/𝑀𝐽,
The well-to-tank emissions for this fuel become:
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺 = 𝐸 (𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺) − 𝐶𝑓𝐶𝑂2/𝐿𝐶𝑉(𝐵𝑖𝑜𝐿𝑁𝐺) =

− 15. 00 − 55. 00 = －70. 00 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽

energy content of which is derived from low-carbon hydrogen (from non-renewable
sources), following the definition in Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2024/1788 (Gas
Directive).
●​ Recycled Carbon Fuels (RCF): Specific type of low-carbon fuels produced from
liquid or solid waste streams of non-renewable origin that are not suitable for material
recovery in accordance with Article 4 of Directive 2008/98/EC, or from waste
processing gas and exhaust gas of non-renewable origin which are produced as an
unavoidable and unintentional consequence of industrial production process,
following the definition in Article 2 of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 (Renewable Energy
Directive).
These fuels should be certified87 under a scheme recognised by the Commission in
accordance with Article 30(5) and (6) of Directive (EU) 2018/2001 or, where applicable, the
relevant provisions of Union legal acts concerning the internal markets in renewable and
natural gases and in hydrogen.
RCFs are certified according to a methodology for assessing GHG emissions savings, as
per Regulation (EU) 2023/1185 supplementing EU RED. An equivalent methodology is still
being drafted for LCFs,88 which are defined as fuels with energy content derived from
non-renewable sources.
Nevertheless, calculation guidance within the context of FuelEU is useful to illustrate how
calculations would be applied to both RCFs and LCFs. This guidance is based on the
already mandated minimum greenhouse gas emission reduction criteria89 for both these
classes of fuels, which require at least a 70 % reduction compared to the fossil fuel
comparator for transport fuels of 94 gCO2eq/MJ.90 This minimum reduction means that the
maximum GHG emission will be stated in a PoS (or equivalent certification document) as a
maximum E value GHG emissions of:
𝐸 (𝑅𝐶𝐹) ≤ (100% − 70%) ×94 = 28. 20000 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽
𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹) ≤ (100% − 70%) ×94 = 28. 20000 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽
Similarly to the RFNBO case, the E value in the PoS document for an RCF or an LCF
already includes fuel-in-use (combustion) emissions according to EU RED methodology
(note: this differs in most cases from FuelEU definition of tank-to-wake emissions). The E
value for RCFs and LCFs is used under FuelEU in a manner equivalent to the calculation
examples for RFNBOs/e-fuels (see Section 1.2.4), where E includes a TtW component “𝑒𝑢”,
representing “emissions from combusting the fuel in its end-use (gCO2eq/MJ fuel)”, which

refer to the “total combustion emissions of the fuel in use”91. Under FuelEU Annex I, the
calculation “Methodology for establishing the GHG intensity of the energy used on board by
a ship”, requires that the well-to-tank GHG emission factor 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇 for RFNBOs and RCFs
(and by extension LCFs, once the methodology for GHG certification is in place) will
necessarily apply a deduction of “𝑒𝑢” , to be subtracted from the E value presented in the
PoS or equivalent certification document, yielding:
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝑅𝐶𝐹 = 𝐸 (𝑅𝐶𝐹) − 𝑒𝑢(𝑅𝐶𝐹)
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝐿𝐶𝐹 = 𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹) − 𝑒𝑢(𝐿𝐶𝐹)
To avoid erroneously double-counting emissions of the fuel in use, it’s important to note that
the GHG intensity formula (Equation 1) in FuelEU Annex I already includes combustion
emissions under tank-to-wake emissions of combusted fuel, “𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑇𝑡𝑊𝑖,𝑗”.92
Additionally, the RFNBO reward factor does not apply to RCF and LCF. This distinction is
crucial: RFNBOs are rewarded with a multiplier of ‘2’ applied to the fuel energy in the
denominator of GHG intensity (Article 5(1) and Annex I of FuelEU). This reward factor (RWDi
= 2) is applicable from 1 January 2025 to 31 December 2033. However, this reward factor
does not apply for RCFs and LCFs, as they are not covered under Article 5, “Use of
Renewable Fuels of Non-Biological Origin”.93 Therefore, an RWDi of ‘1’ applies if fuel i is
certified as an RCF or LCF.

3.5.1 Low-carbon and recycled fuels examples
The following examples demonstrate how certified LCF and RCF affect a ship’s compliance
balance and FuelEU penalties, particularly in the absence of a reward factor multiplier.

Example 1: Recycled Carbon Fuel (RCF)
A ship uses certified recycled carbon methanol RCF methanol, produced from a solid
non-renewable waste stream that is unsuitable for material recovery.94
Based on the PoS (or an equivalent certification document) provided with the fuel delivery,
the following GHG emissions are obtained according to EU RED certification, exemplified
here with a limit value, i.e., the highest accepted in EU RED:95
𝐸 (𝑅𝐶𝐹 𝑀𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙) = 28. 20000 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽,
of which: 𝑒𝑢 (𝑅𝐶𝐹 𝑀𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙) = 68. 9 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽96

Note that “𝑒𝑢 > 𝐸 “ even if “𝑒𝑢” is a parcel of “𝐸”, due to another parcel of the E formula
being negative, specifically “ − 𝑒𝑒𝑥−𝑢𝑠𝑒” which represents avoided “emissions from inputs’
existing use or fate” (97).
The well-to-tank emissions for this fuel become:
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝑅𝐶𝐹 = 𝐸 (𝑅𝐶𝐹) − 𝑒𝑢(𝑅𝐶𝐹) = 28. 2 − 68. 9 = －40. 7 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽
The entire well-to-wake emissions calculation for this fuel is thus (note: here RCF methanol
fuel is shown in isolation from all other energy consumed onboard):
𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑊𝑡𝑊 𝑜𝑓 𝑅𝐶𝐹 𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙 [𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽] = 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇,𝑖/𝑅𝑊𝐷𝑖 +

= 31. 15377 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽
From here, the calculation steps are the same as in Section 1.2.4, except that the multiplier
of 2 as a reward factor for RFNBOs does not apply to RCF methanol in the denominator of
GHG intensity calculation.
In this example, the ship consumes the following amounts over the course of 1 year (full year
2025), with the baseline case of consuming only HFO and MDO/MGO given in brackets:
●​ 11,460 tonnes HFO (baseline: 12 000 tonnes HFO)
●​ 1,100 tonnes RCF methanol (baseline: 0 tonnes methanol)
●​ 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO (baseline: 1400 tonnes MDO/MGO).
Compliance balance results are presented in Table 31. The amount of RCF methanol,
combined with the consumption of other fuels (HFO and MDO/MGO), is sufficient to achieve
compliance (CB = 70 ton CO2eq > 0), resulting in zero FuelEU penalty. It should be noted that
the energy from RCF methanol is not double counted (no RFNBO reward multiplier
applicable, RWD = 1). Therefore, the amount of RCF methanol (~1,100 tonnes) required to
reach compliance (i.e. a CB of at least 0 or positive) is larger than the amount of e-methanol
needed (~400 tonnes of e-methanol, Section 1.4 - Example 6). This is due to two factors: a)
No reward factor for RCF methanol (RWDRCF methanol = 1) and b) The certified GHG emissions
(E value) assumed for RCF methanol (E = 28.2 gCO2eq/MJ) are higher than those assumed
for e-methanol (E = 5 to 10 gCO2eq/MJ, Section 1.4 - Example 6).

Example 2: Low Carbon Fuel (LCF), carbon-containing fuel
A ship uses certified low-carbon methanol (LCF methanol), produced from energy sourced
from low-carbon hydrogen. In this example, the hydrogen is produced by steam-reforming of
natural gas with carbon capture and storage99 (CCS), combined with a biogenic CO2
source100.
Based on the PoS (or an equivalent certification document) provided with the fuel delivery,
the following GHG emissions are obtained according to EU RED certification, exemplified
here with a limit value, i.e. the highest accepted in EU RED:101
𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝑀𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙) = 28. 20000 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽,
of which: 𝑒𝑢 (𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝑀𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙) = 68. 9 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽102
Note that “𝑒𝑢 > 𝐸 “ even if “𝑒𝑢” is a parcel of “𝐸”, due to another parcel of the E formula
being negative, namely “ − 𝑒𝑒𝑥−𝑢𝑠𝑒” which represents avoided “emissions from inputs’
existing use or fate” (103).
The well-to-tank emissions for this fuel become:
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝐿𝐶𝐹 = 𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹) − 𝑒𝑢(𝐿𝐶𝐹) = 28. 2 − 68. 9 = －40. 7 𝑔𝐶𝑂)2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽
The entire well-to-wake emissions calculation for this fuel is as follows (note: here LCF
methanol fuel is shown in isolation of all other energy consumed onboard):
𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑊𝑡𝑊 𝑜𝑓 𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝑚𝑒𝑡ℎ𝑎𝑛𝑜𝑙 [𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽] = 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇,𝑖/𝑅𝑊𝐷𝑖 +
+ (𝐶𝑓𝐶𝑂2,𝑗×𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝑂2 + 𝐶𝑓𝐶𝐻4,𝑗×𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 + 𝐶𝑓𝑁2𝑂,𝑗×𝐺𝑊𝑃𝑁2𝑂)𝑖/(𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖×𝑅𝑊𝐷𝑖) =
99

Note: the carbon incorporated in the chemical composition of the low-carbon methanol is NOT from natural gas (this carbon is captured for
geological storage permitted under Directive 2009/31/EC), but instead from a separate carbon source, in this example a biogenic carbon source.
100
Referring to latest draft of Commission Delegated Regulation supplementing Directive (EU) 2024/1788, in this example the captured CO2
stems from biofuels, bioliquids or biomass fuels complying with the sustainability and greenhouse gas saving criteria set out in Article 29 of
Directive (EU) 2018/2001.

From here, the calculation steps are the same as in Section 1.2.4, except that the multiplier
of 2 as a reward factor for RFNBOs does not apply to LCF methanol in the denominator of
the GHG intensity calculation.
In this example, the ship consumes the following amounts over the course of 1 year (full year

●​ 11,460 tonnes HFO (baseline: 12,000 tonnes HFO)
●​ 1,100 tonnes LCF methanol (baseline: 0 tonnes methanol)
●​ 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO (baseline: 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO).
Compliance balance results are presented in Table 31. The amount of LCF methanol in this
example, combined with the consumption of other fuels (HFO and MDO/MGO), is sufficient
to achieve compliance (CB = 70 ton CO2eq > 0), resulting in zero FuelEU penalty. It should be
noted that the amount of energy from LCF methanol is not double counted (no RFNBO
reward multiplier applicable, RWD = 1). Therefore, the amount of LCF methanol (~1100
tonnes) required to reach compliance (i.e. a CB of at least 0 or positive) is larger than the
amount of e-methanol needed (~400 tonnes of e-methanol, Section 1.4 - Example 6). This is
due to two factors: a) No reward factor for LCF methanol, RWDLCF methanol = 1, and b) The
certified GHG emissions (E value) assumed for LCF methanol (E = 28.2 gCO2eq/MJ) are
higher than those for e-methanol (E = 5 to 10 gCO2eq/MJ, Section 1.4 - Example 6).

Example 3: Low Carbon Fuel (LCF), chemically carbon-free fuel
A ship uses certified low-carbon ammonia (LCF ammonia), produced from energy sourced
from low-carbon hydrogen. In this example, the hydrogen is produced by steam-reforming of
natural gas with carbon capture and storage (CCS). Note that there is no need for a carbon
source in this case, as ammonia does not contain carbon in its chemical composition.
Based on the PoS (or an equivalent certification document) provided with the fuel delivery,
the following GHG emissions are obtained according to EU RED certification, exemplified
here with a limit value, i.e., the highest accepted in EU RED104:
𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑎) = 28. 20000 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽,
of which: 𝑒𝑢 (𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝐴𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑎) assumed to be 0 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽.
The well-to-tank emissions for this fuel become:
𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞𝑊𝑡𝑇, 𝐿𝐶𝐹 = 𝐸 (𝐿𝐶𝐹) − 𝑒𝑢(𝐿𝐶𝐹) = 28. 2 − 0 = 28. 2 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽

The entire well-to-wake emissions calculation for this fuel is as follows (note: here LCF
ammonia fuel is shown in isolation from all other energy consumed onboard):
𝐺𝐻𝐺 𝐼𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑛𝑠𝑖𝑡𝑦 𝑊𝑡𝑊 𝑜𝑓 𝐿𝐶𝐹 𝑎𝑚𝑚𝑜𝑛𝑖𝑎 [𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽] = 𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 𝑊𝑡𝑇,𝑖/𝑅𝑊𝐷𝑖 +
+ (𝐶𝑓𝐶𝑂2,𝑗×𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝑂2 + 𝐶𝑓𝐶𝐻4,𝑗×𝐺𝑊𝑃𝐶𝐻4 + 𝐶𝑓𝑁2𝑂,𝑗×𝐺𝑊𝑃𝑁2𝑂)𝑖/(𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖×𝑅𝑊𝐷𝑖) =
= (28. 2)/(1) + (0×1 + 0. 00005×25 + 0. 00018×298)/( 0. 0186 ×1) =
= 31. 15108 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽
From here, the calculation steps are the same as in Section 1.2.4, except that the multiplier
of 2 as reward factor for RFNBOs does not apply to LCF ammonia in the denominator of
GHG intensity calculation.
In this example, the ship consumes the following amounts over the course of 1 year (full year
2025), with the baseline case of consuming only HFO and MDO/MGO given in brackets:
●​ 11,460 tonnes HFO (baseline: 12,000 tonnes HFO)
●​ 1,176 tonnes LCF ammonia (baseline: 0 tonnes ammonia)
●​ 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO (baseline: 1,400 tonnes MDO/MGO).
Compliance balance results are presented in Table 31. The amount of LCF ammonia in this
example, combined with the consumption of other fuels (HFO and MDO/MGO), is sufficient
to achieve compliance (CB = 70 ton CO2eq > 0), resulting in zero FuelEU penalty.

3.6. Zero-Emission Technologies at Berth (Annex III)
In addition to ship GHG intensity targets (Article 4), the FuelEU mandates zero-emission
requirements for energy use for all electrical power demand at berth (Article 6) for specific
ship types, namely containerships and passenger ships, from 1 January 2030. Specifically, it
requires these ships to connect to on-shore power (OPS) when moored for 2 hours or more.
One exemption105 from the obligation to use OPS while moored at the quayside is the use of
‘zero-emission technologies’ (ZET) that are demonstrated to be ‘equivalent to the use of
OPS’, in which case a ship should be exempted from using OPS.
Article 3(7) defines ZET as technologies that, when in use, do not release GHGs (CO2, CH4,
N2O) or air pollutants (SOx, NOx and particulate matter) into the atmosphere while providing
energy to a ship’s electrical power demand at berth. Essentially, emissions from using ZET
are considered from a tank-to-wake perspective for the purpose of Article 6, zero-emission
requirements for energy use for all electrical power demand at berth.
By nature, OPS has zero tank-to-wake emissions, but depending on the electrical production
pathway, electricity may be associated with upstream emissions. FuelEU stipulates that OPS
should be incentivized by attributing zero upstream emissions (rated as 0 gCO2eq/MJ) to all
electricity delivered by OPS (Recital (44) and Appendix I).
105

The other exemptions are related to lack of OPS availability, among other exemptions not represented by a direct technological alternative to
OPS connection, as is the case for ZETs.

​

pg. 89

As ZET is referred to as an equivalent to OPS (FuelEU Recital 39), one might mistakenly
think that the mass of the fuel used for operating the ZET and its associated well-to-tank
carbon factor also should be similarly counted as zero, as is the case for OPS. However,
this is not the case for ZET: the provisions of Article 4 (accounting for the energy used
onboard) should still be complied with, even when using an “equivalent technology” to OPS.
This requirement is substantiated by Article 7, paragraph 2, which states that:
Monitoring and reporting shall be complete and cover the energy used on board by ships
at any time, whether at sea or at berth.
It is therefore important to note that while Annex I exempts well-to-tank emissions from the
use of electricity, no such exemption is mentioned for ZET in Annex I, II or III.
ZETs are listed in a non-exhaustive table in Annex III of the Regulation, along with general
requirements for such technologies. This list is expected to be amended by future delegated
acts and complemented by implementing acts that define detailed criteria for acceptance,
including the definition of system boundaries and certification requirements for ZETs. The
current non-exhaustive list in Annex III includes the following technologies.
●​ Fuel cells using fuels with zero emissions from a tank-to-wake perspective:​
Fuels that would have zero tank-to-wake CO2 emissions include any kind of
hydrogen and ammonia (fossil, biofuels, e-fuels) as these fuels contain no carbon.
However, it should be noted that ZETs also need to have zero emissions of the other
two defined greenhouse gases, N2O and CH4. In practice, this might exclude NH3 as
its use in fuel cells produces low amounts of N2O, but not zero emissions.
Since fuels used in ZETs form part of the GHG intensity calculation, their upstream
production pathway will impact the compliance balance. See Section 3.6.1 Examples
1 and 2 for renewable hydrogen versus fossil hydrogen, respectively.
●​ On-board electrical energy storage:​
This includes scenarios such as 1) ‘onboard power generation at sea’, where
onboard equipment is used for charging on-board batteries during the voyage, 2)
‘shore side battery charging,’ meaning OPS charging of on-board batteries, or 3)
swapping on-board batteries with pre-charged batteries from ashore. All scenarios
will have zero tank-to-wake emissions.
Since fuels used in ZETs form part of the GHG intensity calculation, their upstream
production pathway will impact the compliance balance. See examples in Section
3.6.1 for OPS charging of batteries versus onboard generation at sea.
●​ On-board power generation from wind and solar power:​
Equipment directly connected to the ship’s switchboard or charging as on-board
intermediate electrical energy storage (such as batteries) is eligible as ZET, provided
it supplies enough power to meet the ship’s electrical demand at berth.

Since no fuel consumption is involved, this technology is treated as equivalent to
using OPS, with a zero GHG intensity contribution (0 g CO2eq/MJ) to the GHG
intensity of the energy used on board by a ship (Article 4 and Annex I). However,
because the energy is generated onboard, it does not fall under the scope of Annex I
definition of 𝐸𝑘, “Electricity delivered to the ship per OPS connection point k [MJ].”
Calculation examples on the effect of onboard power generation on the ship’s
compliance balance are provided below, including example 3.5.0 (baseline case
using OPS) and example 3.5.5 (using onboard power generation from wind and solar
power).
As mentioned, the list of ZETs identified in Annex III may be expanded when delegated acts
under Article 6(6) are adopted and regularly updated by the Commission. Amendments and
additions to this list may require an update of this section showcasing calculation examples.

●​ GWP: In these examples, it is assumed that GWP values for CH4 and N2O follow
IPCC AR5 values, which are expected to be adopted in FuelEU by the time of this
example scenario (2030-2034).

Example 1: Base case with OPS
In this example, a ship consumes the following annual amount of fuels and OPS in the
Reporting Period 2030 (the first year of mandatory connection to OPS for passenger ships
and containerships), all intra-EU (i.e., all port calls and voyages within FuelEU scope):
●​ 11,578 tonnes HFO;
●​ 1,400 tonnes MGO/MDO;
●​ Ek = 4.75 GWh = 17,100,000 MJ OPS, as per electricity delivery notes.
Results in Table 32 show achieved GHG intensity, compliance balance, and resulting
FuelEU penalty. (see step-by-step compliance balance instructions in Section 1.3).
The selected fuel and OPS energy consumption lead to a compliant year for Reporting
Periods 2025-2029. However, since the OPS requirements do not fully enter into force until
2030, the period 2030-2034 has been chosen to better reflect a scenario with the 2030 OPS
mandate. It should be noted however that this does not exclude the voluntary application
(and benefits) of implementing and reporting OPS and ZETs already before 2030.
For the base case scenario with fossil fuels and OPS, an actual GHG intensity of 88.63 g/MJ
is achieved. For the period 2030-2034, the required GHG intensity value is lower than the
achieved GHG intensity, at 85.69 g/MJ, which means that the base case scenario results in
a compliance deficit of 1,602 tonnes, equivalent to a penalty of approximately € 1.1 million.
Throughout Examples 2 through 6, this base case scenario is used as the reference for
comparison.

Example 2: 100% fossil-based hydrogen used in fuel cells to replace OPS
Earlier, it was defined for the purpose of illustrating the compliance balance calculations that
the port stay energy demand for the chosen ship over one year is 4.75 GWh of electrical
energy. This electrical energy demand can be converted into a corresponding fuel mass
using the lower calorific value and the energy converter’s efficiency as follows (same
nomenclature and units as FuelEU):
𝑀𝑖,𝑗 = 𝐸𝑘 / (𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖 · η𝑗) ​

[grams],

where ηj is the energy efficiency of the energy converter j, 𝐸𝑘 is the shore power
energy delivered to the ship, in MJ, and 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖 is the lower calorific value of the fuel, in
MJ/g.

​
The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission,

been approved by any of the members of the ESSF group nor by the European Commission. Instead, it serves as a working draft for FuelEU calculation methodologies

​

pg. 92

This equation is generic for any kind of fuel, but it will be used for hydrogen in this example.
It is assumed in this example that fuel cells would have a fuel conversion efficiency into
electricity of 50% (ηj=0.5). Using the lower calorific value provided in FuelEU for hydrogen
(0.120 MJ/g) and the chosen Ek value of 4.75 GWh = 17,100,000 MJ, the corresponding
mass of hydrogen to be used in a fuel cell system would be 285 tonnes. This amount is
independent of the production pathway of the hydrogen.
Using this value in the FuelEU calculation for compliance balance and comparing it with the
OPS base case, it is found that the CO2eq compliance deficit is increased by approximately
3,049 tonnes, leading to more than double the penalty, from approximately €1.1 million to
approximately €2.9 million. The GHG intensity for the ship in this operational scenario is
93.95 gCO2eq/MJ, of which the contribution of fossil hydrogen is based on default FuelEU
emission factor of 132 gCO2eq/MJ WtW for H2 (natural gas) - Fuel Cells, which moves the
GHG intensity of the ship further above the FuelEU GHG intensity target compared to the
base case of using OPS (see Table 32). This is due to the upstream emissions of the fossil
production pathway of hydrogen, which should thus be taken into account in the calculation
according to default FuelEU emission factors for fossil fuels (Annex II of the Regulation).
Furthermore, the impact on GHG intensity also results from the fact that fuels are weighted
by their chemical energy content, typically higher than that of electricity, while OPS provides
electrical energy, which is rated as zero in the numerator of the GHG intensity formula.
Therefore, removal of OPS is affecting both the numerator and the denominator of the GHG
intensity equation.

Example 3: 100% RFNBO hydrogen used in fuel cells to replace OPS
This example does not differ from Example 1 in terms of equipment and consumption
patterns, assuming the same amounts of hydrogen energy used in fuel cells to replace the
use of OPS. The only difference lies in the upstream emissions associated with the
production pathway of the fuel. FuelEU Annex II does not provide the default value for
RFNBO hydrogen upstream emissions. However, for this example, it is assumed to be 10
gCO2eq/MJ, based on hypothetical GHG emissions in an accepted fuel certificate (PoS or
equivalent certificate) accompanying the bunker delivery note of hydrogen to the ship.
Again, the 4.75 GWh corresponds to the same amount of 285 tonnes of hydrogen as
demonstrated in Example 1 above. However, using a lower-GHG upstream emission
hydrogen and comparing it with the OPS baseline, it is found that the CO2eq compliance
deficit using OPS is reversed to a compliance surplus of 2,312 tonnes, resulting in a
difference in the compliance balance of +3,913 tonnes.
The GHG intensity for this scenario is 81.58 gCO2eq/MJ which is lower than the GHG
intensity target and better than the baseline with OPS. Because the GHG intensity target is
met, there will be no penalty for this scenario in 2030 (see Table 32). This improvement
compared to the base case is explained by the fact that more energy (of low-GHG intensity)
is required to produce the OPS corresponding amount of electricity using fuel cells; in other
words, this energy of low GHG intensity exceeds Ek.

Example 4: Using OPS and charging batteries
This example assumes that for half of the yearly port stays (assuming all port stays last
equally long), the ship will receive OPS delivery corresponding to the hotel load demand plus
additional OPS delivery to charge installed batteries. These batteries will be used later
during the other half of the yearly port stays where OPS is also required. This means the
ship uses OPS for half of its port stays and ZET in the form of pre-charged batteries for the
other half. Ports are not obliged to deliver more energy than what corresponds to the ship’s
hotel load per port stay, so ships should be cautious of using this scenario as a compliance
strategy.
Due to the charging and discharging of batteries, there will be an energy loss, leading to an
increase in energy demand with this strategy. The total energy needed can be expressed
using the equation below, where “portsA” represents half the OPS required during port stays,
charging somewhat more than double the energy demand, accounting for the energy
efficiency penalty for energy storage in batteries, ηB:
𝐸𝑘, 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠𝐴 = 𝐸𝑑 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠𝐴 + (𝐸𝑑 𝑝𝑜𝑟𝑡𝑠𝐵)/η𝐵

[MWh]

= 0. 5 · 𝐸𝑘 + (0. 5 · 𝐸𝑘)/η𝐵

[MWh],

where,​ Ed portsA, represents the OPS energy demand for the port stays in ports A,
​
Ed portsB, represents the energy demand from ZET for the port stays of ports B ,
and
​
ηB, is the overall energy efficiency of battery storage (charging and
discharging).
Using this equation and assuming that ηB is 0.75,106 the amount of OPS that needs to be
delivered to the ship in ports A is 5.54 GWh, instead of the base case Ek of 4.75 GWh.
Using 5.54 GWh as OPS yearly consumption in the FuelEU compliance balance calculation
and comparing it with the OPS base case, it is found that the CO2eq compliance deficit is
lowered by 244 tonnes, due to the increased amount of low-GHG energy required for OPS
charging of batteries as ZET at berth, as a result of losses in battery charging/discharging.
However, this reduction is not sufficient to reach the GHG intensity target. The ship’s GHG
intensity for this scenario is 88.16 gCO2eq/MJ, which is still higher than the GHG intensity
target of 85.60 gCO2eq/MJ, but better than the baseline case with OPS. Again, this
improvement is due to the increased amount of low-GHG energy required for OPS charging
of batteries as ZET at berth, as a result of losses in battery charging/discharging (see Table
32).

Example 5: Charging batteries while at sea with additional fuel on onboard
generators for utilisation of battery power at berth
This scenario provides zero emissions at berth but will result in increased fuel consumption
while at sea. It considers using MGO as fuel in generators or auxiliary engines to charge
batteries with enough electricity to cover the electrical demand at berth, without considering
low-GHG intensity fuels in those generators. This example demonstrates how a ZET can
work against achieving the GHG intensity target. If a lower GHG intensity fuel, such as
bio-diesel, were used instead of MGO, the 2030 GHG intensity target would likely be met.
Note that the current scenario does not consider the possibility in some vessels to charge
the batteries by shaft generators / Power Take Out (PTO) connected to main engines, which
would also be more efficient than auxiliary engines.
For the energy conversion into the mass of fuel, the specific fuel oil consumption (SFOC) of
an auxiliary engine is utilized, as this provides a conservative case compared to PTO.
Besides the propulsion power conversion efficiency, which is included in the SFOC factor,
the energy efficiency of battery storage (charging and discharging losses) also needs to be
considered (ηB). Hence, the mass of fuel can be found using the equation below (same
nomenclature and units as FuelEU):
𝑀𝑖,𝑗 = (𝐸𝑘 · 𝑆𝐹𝑂𝐶𝑖,𝑗)/η𝐵

[grams]

SFOCi,j is assumed to be 200 g/kWh107 of MGO and the energy storage efficiency of
batteries, ηB, is assumed to be 0.75.108 Therefore, the 4.75 GWh of electrical energy from
OPS corresponds to 1,267 tonnes of MGO when generating electricity at sea for storing in
batteries and utilization as ZET at berth.
In this scenario of charging batteries at sea with fossil MGO, the GHG intensity results in
91.41 gCO2eq/MJ, which is well above the GHG intensity target for 2030 and also higher
than the base case of using OPS at berth. This results in a penalty of approximately
€2.1 million, about double compared to OPS baseline case. The total CO2eq compliance
deficit is 3,334 tonnes, which is worse than the OPS base case by 1,733 tonnes. However, it
should be noted that if another fuel, such as drop-in bio-diesel, had been used at sea to
charge the batteries, the vessel would probably reach the GHG intensity target with zero
FuelEU penalty.

Example 6: Solar and/or wind generated electricity while in port
This scenario assumes that a ship can generate enough direct electricity using solar power
and/or wind power while in port. Although this scenario might not be the most realistic as it
does not include the use of batteries, it provides valuable insights into the consequences of
such choice in terms of FuelEU GHG intensity and compliance balance. Generating
electricity at sea would require battery installation, which would come with respective energy
losses.

Since only the electricity source from OPS, Ek, can be included in the FuelEU calculation,
electricity generated onboard from solar or wind will not positively impact a ship’s GHG
intensity calculation. Instead, it reduces the amount of energy reported, reducing Mi and Ek in
the compliance balance formula of Annex IV.
In this example, the GHG intensity for the scenario of onboard solar/wind generation of
electricity is 91.49 g/MJ, which is above the GHG intensity target for 2030 and higher than
the baseline case. This results in a penalty of approximately €2 million, almost double of the
OPS baseline case. The total CO2eq compliance deficit is 3,067 tonnes, which is 1,465
tonnes worse than the OPS baseline case.

3.6.2 Conclusion for Annex III zero emission technologies at berth
Where a ship is required to use OPS per FuelEU Article 6, the only other options to
substitute OPS to meet or exceed compliance in terms of GHG intensity targets is by using
renewable or other low-GHG fuel in fuel cells, or using low-GHG intensity fuels (e.g.,
bio-diesel) in onboard generators or shaft generators for charging batteries (note this
example is not provided in this document).
To allow for comparability across the examples in this chapter, the same energy demand and
fuel types as in the base case are used. As the OPS requirement for passenger and
container ships begins on 1 January 2030, that year is used as the reference, unlike Chapter
1, which uses 2025–2029. In most examples, OPS or fossil-based ZET alone at berth is not
sufficient to meet the GHG intensity target. This demonstrates that the main contributor to
compliance is typically the choice of fuels used at sea.
It should be noted that, provided there is no change in other fuels used at sea, only the ZET
example of fuel cells with RFNBO-hydrogen lead to compliance with the GHG intensity
target in the year 2030. This result would change in 2035 when a lower GHG intensity target
is mandated. In this case, even fuel cells with RFNBO-hydrogen would not meet the 2035
GHG targets.

4.​ Chapter 4: Flexibility Mechanisms
4.1.​ Introduction
The compliance balance for the Reporting Period is calculated using the formula set out in
FuelEU Annex IV Part A, based on the GHGIE actual109 derived from the FuelEU Report
data.110 Compliance balances can be positive, negative, or zero. The regulation is designed
to incentivize companies to achieve a compliance balance below the GHGIE target
established in FuelEU Article 4. To support compliance, the FuelEU provides flexibility
mechanisms.
Flexibility mechanisms create an alternative compliance option for ships with a FuelEU
deficit and support the deployment of the most advanced solutions for ships with a
compliance surplus. The mechanism aims to create a virtuous cycle, incentivizing the lowest
GHG intensity technologies and accelerating the uptake of such technologies in the maritime
industry.

4.2.​ Key Concepts and Definitions
FuelEU Articles 20 and 21 define three flexibility options, which are described below.
1.​ Banking: is a compliance option that allows companies to accumulate the
over-performance of one ship in terms of compliance balance over the years. This
accumulated surplus can be used in subsequent years to offset deficits of that
specific ship or other ships through the pooling mechanism.; or
2.​ Borrowing: is a compliance option that allows companies to borrow an Advance
Compliance Surplus from the following year, with the obligation to repay it with an
additional 10% in the next period; or
3.​ Pooling: to avoid technology lock-in and continue supporting the deployment of the
most performant solutions, companies are allowed to pool the compliance balance of
ships. This means using the over-compliance (surpluses) of one or more ships to
compensate for the under-compliance (deficits) of other ships, provided that the total
pooled compliance is positive. As with all flexibility mechanisms, the possibility to
pool compliance is voluntary and requires prior agreements between the participating
companies.
Below is a list of definitions used throughout this Chapter.
●​ Adjusted Compliance Balance Year N (Adjusted CB Year N) [gCO2eq]: The sum of
the Initial Compliance Balance Year N plus the Banked Surplus from previous
periods, minus the Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus Year N-1 from the
previous Reporting Period Year N-1. It can be positive, negative or zero. Calculated
by 31 March of the Verification Period Year N+1.

4.3.​ Borrowing
4.3.1.​

Guidance on borrowing compliance

Borrowing, as defined above, is a compliance option that allows companies to borrow a
certain amount of compliance balance (referred to as “Advance Compliance Surplus” in
FuelEU) to compensate for a deficit in the Adjusted Compliance Balance of the Reporting
Period Year N, calculated during Verification Period Year N+1. Borrowing is always meant to
be from the following year, i.e., Reporting Period Year N+1.
Companies should repay this amount with an aggravation of 10% (the Aggravated Advance
Compliance Surplus, see Section 4.3.2) in the next period, deducting it from the Adjusted
Compliance Balance Year N+1, as stated in Article 20 of FuelEU.
Requirements
The Advance Compliance Surplus may not be:
●​ borrowed for two consecutive Reporting Periods; or
●​ borrowed for an amount exceeding 2% of the greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity target
of Reporting Period Year N, multiplied by the ship’s energy consumption, as
calculated in accordance with FuelEU Annex I.
Timeline and responsibilities
Borrowing is possible during the Verification Period Year N+1, after the issuance of the
Adjusted Compliance Balance and before 30 April of the Verification Period Year N+1. The
ISM company is responsible for requesting borrowing in THETIS MRV system, while the
Verifier is responsible for assessing and verifying the requested and correct amount to be
borrowed.

The GHGIE target Year N to be considered for the calculation of the Advance Compliance
Surplus is the one related to the Reporting Period (Year N). Year N in the calculation
refers to the Reporting Period. For example, during the calculation of the Adjusted
Compliance Balance for Year 2029, which occurs during the Verification Period in Year 2030,
the GHGIE target will be the 2029 GHGIE target. This remains true even though the GHGIE
target changes between the Reporting and Verification Periods from 2% to 6 % reduction of
the reference value 91.16 gCO2eq/MJ, changing from 89.33680 gCO2eq/MJ in 2029 to
85.69040 gCO2eq/MJ in 2030). Therefore, the GHGIE target for Year 2029 to be
considered for the calculation of the ACB Year N limit will be 89.33680 gCO2eq/MJ,
even if the ship is actually borrowing from the following period (2030), where the GHGIE
target is 85.6904 gCO2eq/MJ.
With the example of 15,000 MJ of energy in scope, below is the calculation of maximum
ACS for Reporting Periods 2029 and 2030:
𝐴𝐶𝑆 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 2029 ≤ 2% × (98% × 91. 16 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽) × 15, 000 𝑀𝐽 ​
𝐴𝐶𝑆 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 2029 ≤ 2% × 89. 3368 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 × 15, 000 𝑀𝐽 = 26, 801. 04 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 ​
𝐴𝐶𝑆 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 2030 ≤ 2% × (94% × 91. 16 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽) × 15, 000 𝑀𝐽 ​
𝐴𝐶𝑆 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 2030 ≤ 2% × 85. 6904 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 × 15000 𝑀𝐽 = 25, 707. 12 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞 ​
As defined in Annex-I, Question A.20,111 the Advance Compliance Surplus borrowed from the
next Reporting Period should exactly match the amount corresponding to the compliance
deficit calculated. Therefore, borrowing is not possible if the Adjusted Compliance
Balance of the Reporting Period Year N exceeds 2% x ( GHGIE target Year N) x Energy
consumption:

Borrowing during a Verification Period prevents a company from joining a Pool during the
same Verification Period. Nevertheless, if a company borrowed during a Verification Period,
it is still possible to join a pool during the following year, even if the ship’s compliance
balance is affected by the resulting Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus.
Lastly, it is important to highlight what happens in the event of no EU port calls for a ship
which applied for borrowing in the previous year. The ISM company will be notified by the
associated Administering State of the amount of the FuelEU penalty according to the Article
20(4):
where a ship does not have any port call in the Union during the Reporting Period and
borrowed an advance compliance surplus in the previous Reporting Period, the competent
authority of the administering State shall notify by 1 June of the Verification Period to the
company concerned the amount of the FuelEU penalty as referred to in Article 23(2) that it

𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 = 91. 16 𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞/𝑀𝐽 × 𝑟𝑒𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁%
The Initial Compliance Balance of Year N (ICB Year N) is calculated during Verification
Period Year N+1 and refers to the ship’s energy performance during the Reporting Period
Year N, using relevant input data (e.g., fuel consumption, GHGIE target Year N). It considers
the difference between the GHGIE target for Year N and the actual GHGIE for Year N, as
shown in the examples in Section 1.4. The Initial Compliance Balance formula is:
𝑛𝑓𝑢𝑒𝑙

⎡

𝐼𝐶𝐵 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁 [𝑔𝐶𝑂2𝑒𝑞] = (𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑡𝑎𝑟𝑔𝑒𝑡 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁 − 𝐺𝐻𝐺𝐼𝐸 𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑢𝑎𝑙 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁) × ⎢ ∑ 𝑀𝑖 × 𝐿𝐶𝑉𝑖 + ∑ 𝐸𝑗 ⎥

⎣
⎦
The Adjusted Compliance Balance of Year N (ACB Year N) considers the Previous
Banked Surplus (PBS Year (N-1)) stored in the previous period Year N-1 and the
Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus (Aggravated ACS Year N-1), which is 10%
more of the Advance Compliance Surplus, coming from the previous period if borrowed.
𝐴𝐶𝐵 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁 = 𝐼𝐶𝐵 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 𝑁 + 𝑃𝐵𝑆 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 (𝑁 − 1) − 𝐴𝑔𝑔𝑟𝑎𝑣𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝐴𝐶𝑆 𝑌𝑒𝑎𝑟 (𝑁 − 1)
The Aggravated ACS Year (N-1) is equal to zero if the company decided not to opt for
borrowing during Year N-1. If this applies and if the Adjusted Compliance Balance Year N is
less than 2% x GHGIE target Year N x Energy in Scope, companies are entitled to opt for
Borrowing in the event of a negative Adjusted Compliance Balance of Year N.
Before 31 March of the Verification Period Year N+1, verifiers calculate the Adjusted
Compliance Balance Year N, considering the input data (e.g., fuel consumption, GHGIE
target Year N) of the Reporting Period Year N. When the flexibility mechanism starts during
Verification Period Year N+1, if a company chooses to opt for borrowing, the Advance
Compliance Surplus Year N has to be calculated.
The Advance Compliance Surplus Year N (ACS Year N) to be borrowed during Verification
Period Year N+1 has a maximum limit equal to 2% of the GHGIE target Year N multiplied by
the energy in scope of FuelEU for Reporting Period Year N.

4.4.​ Banking
4.4.1.​

Guidance on banking compliance

After calculating the Adjusted Compliance Balance for Year N during the Verification
Period Year N+1, ships may either have a deficit or a surplus. Ships can then join a pool
(see Section 4.5) to reduce or cancel their deficits or to pass on their surplus. Once a ship
exits a pool, it may have a surplus or a remaining deficit (but not a higher one). Surplus can
be banked according to FuelEU Article 20(1).
Requirements for banking a surplus
ISM companies are allowed to bank only if the Verified Compliance Balance of Year N is
positive.
In the event of a surplus of the Adjusted Compliance Balance, the company may choose to
directly bank the surplus in THETIS MRV IT system, pool the surplus or opt not to bank. The
decision not to bank may occur if, for example, the company participates in a voluntary GHG
emission reduction scheme with additionality restrictions. On the other hand, in the event of
a deficit of the Adjusted Compliance Balance, the company may join a pool (and exit with a
reduced deficit or a surplus from it) or decide not to join a pool and immediately pay the
penalties.
Ultimately, once the Verified Compliance Balance Year N is assessed by the Verifier and
if it is positive, the ISM company again may bank this surplus or opt not to bank.
Timeline and responsibilities
In the event of a surplus resulting from a positive Verified Compliance Balance, whether from
a pooling mechanism or over-compliant energy performance, companies are entitled to
register the surplus as Banked Surplus in THETIS MRV. This has to be done by the ISM
company after the calculation and assessment of the Verified Compliance Balance by its
Verifier and before 30 June of the Verification Period Year N+1. The Verifier then needs to
confirm and accept the amount of banked surplus in THETIS MRV. It is important to note that
once the FuelEU DoC is issued by the Verifier, it will no longer be possible to register the
surplus in THETIS MRV.
Rules for banking a Surplus
Banked surpluses are cumulative and can be used in all subsequent Verification Periods
without any expiration limitations. It is also possible to use banked surpluses from previous
Reporting Periods in a compliance pool in future periods, as these surpluses are added to
the Adjusted Compliance Balance calculations.

Figure 7. Rules for banking a surplus

As previously explained, ships with a surplus may choose not to bank or pool, but instead to
cancel the surplus. In such cases, the Compliance Balance for that Verification Period will be
zero, and no penalties will be incurred. In addition, for auditing and tracking purposes, it
would be appropriate for verifiers to issue a receipt or a certificate in the event of a surplus
not banked.

4.5.​ Pooling
4.5.1.​

Guidance on pooling compliance

Pooling is a compliance option that allows companies to compensate for the
under-performance (deficit) of one or more ships with the over-performance (surplus) of one
or more ships from one or more ISM companies. The exchange of Pooling Compliance
Balance quotas (in tonnes CO2eq) is a linear and direct exchange among a pool of ships, not
a weighted average. According to ISM Companies private agreements, ships will “sell and/or
buy” their surplus and/or deficits of Adjusted Compliance Balances, initially calculated as per
FuelEU Annex IV Part A.
Requirements
The requirements for a pool to be valid are:
1.​ The ship is within the scope of FuelEU: ships above 5,000 GT and that carry cargo or
passengers, with at least one EEA port call in one Reporting Period from 2025, are in
scope of FuelEU;
2.​ The ship has not borrowed compliance in the current Verification Period;​
3.​ The ship is not included in another pool of Compliance Balance for GHG intensity;​
4.​ The sum of the initial Compliance Balance of the ships included in the pool is positive
or zero (including banking and borrowing of previous periods);​
5.​ Ships in the pool must possess a valid FuelEU DoC from the most recent Verification
Period during which they were within the scope of FuelEU.

​

pg. 105

Timeline and responsibilities
One ISM Company (from now on the "Starter Company") with responsibility with one or more
vessels which intends to trigger a pooling, first needs to identify the ships to be included in the
pool. Secondly, the Starter Company proposes, after concluding private agreements among the
companies, the allocation of compliance balances. Then all ISM Companies involved in the
pooling arrangement should accept or reject the allocation proposed.

The Starter Company identifies a Unique Verifier, who could be different from the verifiers
that calculated the adjusted Compliance Balances for each ship before 31 March of the
Verification Period. This Unique Verifier has to assess and verify the final outcome of the
pooling arrangement.
Once a ship exits a pool, it cannot borrow, participate in other pools, or accumulate more
surplus. Below a simple timeline of a pooling option.
Figure 8. Timeline and responsibilities

Rules for the allocation of Compliance Balances
There are essentially two main rules for pooling allocation:
●​ A ship that enters the pool with a deficit may not exit with an increased deficit.
●​ A ship that enters a pool with a positive or zero compliance balance may not exit with
a deficit.
It is possible that all ships in the executed pool exit with compliance balances equal to zero
or with a surplus. However, due to Requirement 4 (see above) which states that the sum of
compliance balances should be zero or positive, it is also possible for ships to exit the pool
with a deficit, provided that the total compliance balance is zero or positive and the deficit is
not greater than the ship’s initial deficit (see Table 33).
It is also possible to join a pool where all ships are already compliant (i.e., all compliance
balances are positive), to simply exchange surplus among ships and reallocate the
compliance balances.

In Allocation Alternative 1, Ship A and D have shared surplus so that all ships in the pool
have a positive compliance balance. In Allocation Alternative 2, the sum of the compliance
balances for all ships is positive but Ship E exits the pool with a remaining deficit less than
the pre-pool deficit. Both allocations are allowed within the boundaries of the requirements
and rules (along with numerous other options). Please note that in Allocation Alternative 2,
Ship E will have a negative Verified Compliance Balance equal to -80, meaning the ISM
company of Ship E will be required to pay a penalty.
Ships with residual Banked surpluses or Borrowing Deficits, without EEA port calls in
Year N
If there are no EEA port calls during a certain Reporting Period Year N, a ship that was in
scope during a previous Reporting Period from 2025, with a residual Banked Surplus or with
a Borrowing Deficit (Aggravated Advance Compliance Surplus), can join a pool during the
related Verification Period Year N+1.
Therefore, such a ship can:
●​ Use its residual Banked Surplus to join a pool and potentially monetize surpluses, or
●​ Compensate for its residual Borrowing Deficit by joining a Pool.
This is also true when the ship does not have EEA port calls in the following Reporting
Period.

4.5.2.​

Revisions of compliance balance by administering states and additional
checks

Administering States may, at any time, conduct additional checks on the entire compliance
process under FuelEU for the two previous Reporting Periods. This could lead to the
detection of incorrect Adjusted Compliance Balances, which would affect previous pools. In
such cases, it would mean that certain requirements for the validity of those pools were
mistakenly considered fulfilled.

​
The European Sustainable Shipping Forum (ESSF) provides a platform for structural dialogue, exchange of technical knowledge, cooperation and coordination between the Commission,
Member States’ authorities and maritime transport stakeholders on issues pertaining to the sustainability and the competitiveness of EU maritime transport. This document has not

​

pg. 107

If an Administering State detects an error in compliance balance, FuelEU Article 17(4)
provides that the company responsible for the error will be notified of this and, if a negative
compliance balance results, the company in question should pay a penalty equal to the
related amount in Euros to resolve the inconsistency.
If an Administering State detects such an error in the Compliance Balance of a ship that
joined a pool, this ship will have to revise its final Verified Compliance Balance for that year
and eventually pay a penalty if its compliance balance ends up being negative in that
Reporting Period.
It is important to note that such a correction may also retroactively invalidate the pool. A pool
is deemed invalid if, following an additional check by an Administering State, both of the
following conditions are met:
1.​ One or more ships have to consider a lower Adjusted Compliance Balance for a
specific previous Verification Period; and
2.​ One or more of these ships joined a pool in previous Verification Periods and the
initial sum of the Adjusted Compliance Balances is now negative, after these
additional checks.
Specifically, the above situation does not satisfy Requirement 4 (See Section 4.5.1, the sum
of the initial Compliance Balance of the ships in the pool is not positive or zero, including
banking and borrowing from previous periods). The outcome of the pool remains valid for the
other ships not affected directly by the findings of the additional checks. This ensures that
other ships, without errors in their Adjusted Compliance Balances, are not impacted by this
additional check. The ship(s) identified as having an error will have their Verified Compliance
Balances revised accordingly and will incur a penalty to the extent their revised
pool-allocation Verified Compliance Balances are negative, i.e., taking into account that the
already allocated compliance to other ships in the pool remains unchanged.
Regardless of whether the ship participated in a pool or not, a new FuelEU DoC should be
issued by the Administering State whenever an Additional Check results in a downward
revision of the Adjusted Compliance Balance. The new DoC should not have a longer
validity than the DoC held at the time of the Additional Check and, in any case, should expire
at the next regular DoC issuance deadline for the subsequent Verification Period.
Consider the following Example in Table 34. The initial compliance balance sum was 25
tCO2eq for this pool of five ships. After an additional check conducted within two years by
Administering State X on Ship A, an error was found in the calculations of its Adjusted
Compliance Balance, which should have been 95, not 150 tCO2eq. Pooling should have
been invalid because the initial sum would have been negative (in this case -30), but pooling
still took place.​
​
Therefore, the pool’s outcome is considered frozen. Only ship A is impacted by the
additional check of Member State X. In this case, since the revised Verified Compliance
Balance for Ship A is negative, a penalty is calculated with a compliance balance of -30

4.6.​ Timeline and Workflow
The following outlines the timeline and possible pathways from the submission of the FuelEU
Report by the ISM company to the issuance of the FuelEU DoC by the verifier or
administering authority. It covers key elements of the compliance process, including:
●​ The ship’s Adjusted Compliance Balance (ACB), which may be positive or
negative;
●​ The application of flexibility mechanisms (such as banking, borrowing, and
pooling);
●​ The calculation of penalties where applicable;
●​ The determination of the Verified Compliance Balance (VCB); and
●​ The final issuance of the DoC, including any reissuance due to Additional Checks or
errors.
Each step represents a potential outcome or action depending on the ship’s compliance
performance and the data reported and verified during the annual reporting cycle.
